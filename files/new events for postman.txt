        "description_text": "The Tangsa or Tangshang Naga is a community of perhaps 100,000 living on both sides of the India-Myanmar border, mostly in the north of Sagaing Region and in Arunachal Pradesh on the India side. There are around 80 \u2018sub-tribes\u2019 of the Tangsa/Tangshang, each of which has its own linguistic variety. Some of these are fully mutually intelligible, effectively different dialects, but some are so different as to be not mutually intelligible. They represent a significant part of the many 100s of Naga languages and dialects.\nThis presentation, which will be illustrated by video and audio examples, will discuss and analyse traditional songs of the Tangsa.\nSpeakers:\nStephen Morey is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Languages and Linguistics, La Trobe University. He has researched smaller, underdescribed languages on both sides of the India-Myanmar\nborder, belong to the Tai, Singpho and Naga language groups. This work has included a detailed documentation and study of traditional songs. He also researches the historical materials relating to the indigenous languages of Victoria.\nJ\u00fcrgen Sch\u00f6pf studied musicology, linguistics, and anthropology at the Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. He worked as a recording engineer while preparing his doctoral dissertation in Ethnomusicology. He is now at La Trobe University, documenting minority cultures in the Northeast India/Myanmar border area.\nVong Tsuh Shi is a post graduate student in Latrobe University. Her study focuses on Wihu song of Tangsa / Tangshang Naga. She did her Masters degree in Linguistics in Payap University, Thailand, later working with a prominent linguistics NGO. Before resuming her doctoral study, she volunteered to help more than fifty ethnic language groups in writing language guides for language teachers in a UNICEF (Myanmar) project.\n\n5:30pm for a 6:00pm start.

In the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland, everyday militarization, violence, and the scramble for natural resources regulate the lives of Naga, Ahom, and Adivasi people, as well as migrants from elsewhere in the region, as they struggle to find peace and work.\nAnthropologist Dolly Kikon uses in-depth ethnographic accounts to address the complexity of Northeast India, a region between Southeast Asia and China where boundaries and borders are made, disputed, and maintained. Bringing a fresh and exciting direction to borderland studies, she explores the social bonds established through practices of resource extraction and the tensions these relations generate, focusing on peoples' love for the landscape and for the state, as well as for family, friends, and neighbours.\u00a0Living with Oil and Coal\u00a0illuminates questions of citizenship, social justice, and environmental politics that are shared by communities worldwide.\nAbout the author:\nDolly Kikon is a senior lecturer in the Anthropology and Development Studies Program at the University of Melbourne. She is the author of\u00a0Life and Dignity: Women's Testimonies of Sexual Violence in Dimapur (Nagaland)\u00a0and\u00a0Experiences of Naga Women in Armed Conflict: Narratives from a Militarized Society.",

        "description_text": "Keywords for India Lecture Series\nEmpire\nwith Professor Sanjay Subrahmayam\u00a0\nAbout the talk:\nTo some 'empire' in the context of India/South Asia is necessarily a reference to the British Raj, especially after 1858. But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nProfessor Sanjay Subrahmayam,\u00a0Distinguished Professor & Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA.\u00a0\nSanjay Subrahmanyam, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford. Educated at the Delhi School of Economics, the first decade of his working career was spent (with brief interruptions in Philadelphia and Cambridge) teaching economic history and comparative economic development at the same institution, where he was eventually\u00a0named Professor of Economic History (1993-95). Thereafter, Subrahmanyam taught from 1995 to 2002 as Directeur d\u2019\u00e9tudes in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris),\u00a0where\u00a0his position was on the economic and social history of early modern India and the Indian Ocean world.\u00a0In 2002, Subrahmanyam was appointed as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Indian History and Culture at the University of Oxford, a position he held for two years.\nAfter joining UCLA, Subrahmanyam served from 2005 to 2011 as founding Director of UCLA's\u00a0Center for India and South Asia.\u00a0He teaches courses on medieval and early modern South Asian and Indian Ocean history, the history of European expansion, the comparative history of early modern empires, and various aspects of world history. He continues to advise graduate students on Indian history, the history of the Iberian empires, and more generally on forms of \"connected histories\".\u00a0Subrahmanyam was Joint Managing Editor of the\u00a0Indian Economic and Social History Review\u00a0for over a decade, besides serving on the boards of a number of other journals in the US, UK, France, Portugal, and elsewhere. He was also one of the founding editors of the \"South Asia Across the Disciplines (SAAD)\" monograph series.In 2013, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was elected to a Chair in Early Modern Global History at the\u00a0Coll\u00e8ge de France\u00a0in Paris, and delivered a full series of lectures there over the year 2013-14. Since 2014 he continues to lecture as a long-term visiting professor, and has a regular media presence in France:\u00a0TV interviews appear for example\u00a0on\u00a0MediaPart\u00a0(May 2014), and\u00a0on\u00a0France Info\u00a0(April 2015).\u00a0Sanjay Subrahmanyam's book\u00a0Europe's India: Words, People, Empires, 1500-1800,\u00a0appeared in 2017 from Harvard University Press, and in a French translation in 2018. Another book,\u00a0Empires Between Islam and Christianity, 1500-1800,\u00a0has appeared in 2018 in the Indian edition (Permanent Black) and the US edition in 2019.\nIn February 2019, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was awarded the Dan David Prize for History (jointly with Kenneth Pomeranz, Chicago).",

        "description_text": "The administration of end of life care in China differs substantially from its organisation in the West. This presentation examines how the unequal distribution of health resources and increasing economisation of the medical industry in China creates problems for access to, and the quality of, end of life care. I suggest that we first need to recognise how the language of economisation suffuses relations between ageing patients, families and medical practitioners, before tracing how socioeconomic inequalities can lead to differential experiences of end of life care. This presentation thus explores how end of life care is becoming economised in China, and how patients themselves increasingly participate in an economy of \u2018financialised human capital\u2019.\nAbout the Speaker\nDr Marc Trabsky is a Senior Lecturer at La Trobe Law School and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Health Law and Society, La Trobe University. He writes in the intersections of legal theory, history and the humanities. His research examines the\u00a0theoretical, historical and institutional arrangements of law and death. His most recent monograph is titled Law and the Dead: Technology, Relations and Institutions (Routledge, 2019).",
