      "text": "Assessment shock: Understanding Chinese international students' first year experiences in Australian universities\nDr Jiming Zhou, College of Foreign Languages and Literature, Fudan University\nEducation practitioners in Australian universities face an ongoing problem: how can we acculturate the large population of Chinese international students to the Australian university learning context? Join Fudan University's Dr Jiming Zhou as she discusses the concept of “assessment shock” as experienced by Chinese international students in their first year in Australian universities, the cognitive and socio-cultural reasons behind the shock, and the pedagogical implications for assessment design and enactment.\nThis seminar shares findings from a recent project exploring Chinese international students’ perceptions and practices related to assessment tasks in the first year at Deakin University. Ten students were recruited from each of the four broad disciplinary fields most frequently studied by Chinese international students, i.e. management and commerce, engineering and related technologies, information technology, and arts and education. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted to explore students’ understandings and behavior related to various assessment tasks. One unit chair/tutor from each broad discipline was also interviewed to compare and contrast the educators’ perspective. \nFindings suggest prior assessment experience mediates students’ perception of assessment tasks and culture. Students reported difficulties in 1) appreciating the values of some higher-order skills assessed in university contexts; 2) developing sophisticated understandings about “abstract” criteria; and 3) interacting with tutors about the meanings of assessment tasks and the way to move forward. \nThe seminar will conclude with discussions about how understanding “assessment shock” carries the potential to enhance first-year student transition and develop learner assessment literacy.\nAfter Jiming's presentation, join us for afternoon tea to continue the conversation around understanding the experiences of first-year Chinese students in Australian universities.\nThis seminar will be available across all Deakin campuses via Skype for Business (please select your location via the ticketing options for room details), and will also be accessible to all non-Deakin locations online or over the phone (please select this ticketing option for further details).\n\nJiming Zhou is a senior lecturer at Fudan University, China. She holds a PhD in education from the University of Hong Kong. Her current research interests include assessment and learning, educational innovation, and students’ school-university transition."

      "text": "ACBC Victoria is pleased to invite you to our event ‘Capturing the Chinese Tourist Market’, with Bill Lang, Adjunct Fellow, VBCI, Chairman Institute of Advanced Business\nOver the next 10 years, Chinese visitors to Australia are expected to grow by 11.9 percent per annum. Inbound Chinese tourism to Victoria is forecast to be worth $7.0 billion in 2026-27 (+10.3% pa) and contribute 39 per cent to total expenditure in Victoria.\nWith this in mind it’s imperative that businesses are prepared to provide payment systems, hospitality and appropriate communication to meet the needs of Chinese tourists in Australia. To ‘capture’ this market, businesses need to have systems in place that will enable them to leverage opportunities across a wide range of sectors.\nDuring this session, Bill will share his expertise on doing business with Chinese consumers, so you leave with a greater understanding of how to connect with this burgeoning market of customers.\nAbout the Speaker\nBill Lang is an expert in applying the latest strategies to help people rapidly build and develop digital skills to start and grow businesses. After graduating from Harvard Business School’s MBA as a Baker Scholar, Bill founded consulting, training, internet services and marketing technology businesses that have served clients operating in over 50 countries and educated over 100,000 people through his presentations, TV series, books and online services. Many of his clients have achieved significant business improvements and awards including Best in the World, Best in Europe and Best in Asia.\nVictoria University is conveniently located at 300 Flinders Street opposite Flinders Street railway station and you can also travel via tram or bus. Please visit the Public Transport Victoria site to plan your journey. Commercial parking is also available close to 300 Flinders Street."

   "description": {
      "text": "\nhttp://www.itpm.com/seminars/ \nChinese GDP is slowing down hard and may collapse. This will have significant impacts on the Australian Economy. All Retail Traders in Australia need to know how to not only protect their wealth from this collapse but also how to make money from it. \nThe Chinese Economy is incredibly important for the Australian Economy. Predicting the Chinese Economy leads all outcomes in Australian GDP and Financial Markets. Predicting Chinese Macro' trends is therefore incredibly important for Australian investors and traders. Notoriously hard to predict due to creative accounting practices and outright exagerration, Chinese Macreconomics and the Macro' landscape leads many investors and traders to false conclusions. Especially in 2018 and 2019 when there has been a marked slowdown in Chinese Growth that has been masked for many quarters with exagerrated Macro' predictions, now more than ever it is vitally important to know how this works! \nIn this seminar Ross Williams is going to show you how to predict Chinese GDP accurately using refined and bespoke indicators that are either overlooked or not widely known by the public and show you how to use this data to position yourself for massive ROI in your trading accounts. This is especially useful when Chinese GDP is slowing for Australian Retail Traders, as they can position themselves ahead of any collapse and profit from it when everyone else in Australia loses significant money.    \nVIDEO >>>\n\nWATCH ROSS WILLIAMS BEING INTERVIEWED BY ANTON KREIL;- CLICK HERE\n\n>>\n\n\nSeminar Content & Timetable;-\n6.15pm registration, 7pm start.\n\n\n\nHow to Predict Chinese GDP Accurately\n\n\nBespoke Indicators to Predict Chinese Boom and Bust\n\n\nQualitative Assessment\n\n\nUsing the Data and Positioning for Massive ROI\n\n\n\n Seminar Speaker\n\nRoss Williams - Senior Trading Mentor - Institute of Trading and Portfolio Management\nRoss Williams is a Professional Trader / Hedge Fund Portfolio Manager. Ross started his career in 1998 in London at CIBC World Markets in Fixed Income, trading Derivatives and credit products. He then moved to work for Bear Stearns on their Proprietary Trading Desk from 2001-2006 and was promoted to Managing Director in 2005.\nHe cashed out at Bear Stearns and joined a Hedge Fund (Peloton Partners) in 2006 with other partners from Goldman Sachs, trading all Asset Classes (Rates, Equities, Currencies, Commodities)  The fund had the backing of many of the worlds preeminent investors. Peloton quickly grew to $2.8Bn in Assets Under Management (AUM) due to an 87% performance in the mortgage fund in 2007. Peloton Partners was named Eurohedge Hedge Fund of the Year in Europe in 2007. In 2008 the Global Financial crisis occurred and forced redemptions at the fund. Something that was out of the control of the firm. Investors wanted their money back because everything else in the world was collapsing. The partners agreed to return investors capital and close the fund down.\nRoss then returned to his native Australia where he joined the UBS Proprietary Trading operation in Sydney as a Prop' Trader Trading across asset classes. Ross now works for Peninsula Strategies in Sydney (a private investment firm) as a Portfolio Manager specialising in Long / Short Equities Portfolio Management and tactical asset allocation and also as a Senior Trading Mentor and asset allocator at the Institute of Trading and Portfolio Management, helping Retail Traders get consistent profitability in their portfolio's.   \nRoss Williams Resume / CV - Click Here\n\nBackground\n\nThe Institute of Trading and Portfolio Management was established to educate, inform and coach Retail Traders & Investors how to take a more Professional approach to Trading and Investing in the Financial Markets. We deliver the highest level of Trading and Portfolio Management education available to the Retail Trader / Investor globally, utilising teaching methods that everyone can understand and deploy themselves.

      "text": "Collaborate. Negotiate. Resolve conflict. Optimise stakholder alignment.\nIf you are conducting negotiations with Chinese counterparts, a strong understanding of how process, commercial issues and culture impacts negotiation styles is critical. • What processes may be adopted to achieve mutual gains with a Chinese counterpart in a negotiation? • How do you plan for and respond to lengthy multi-stage negotiations with Chinese counterparts? • How does culture affect commercial outcomes in a negotiation with Chinese counterparts? \nThe ApproachThis practical, participatory one-day program combines global perspectives on cross-cultural negotiation with Australian executive insights and reflections from Chinese counterparts. It incorporates the Consensus Building Institute’s world-leading Mutual Gains Approach, built in partnership with faculty from Harvard and MIT, which utilises a practical four-step methodology for improving negotiation results in Chinese contexts:\n1. Prepare – Estimate your Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) and identify the interests of your Chinese counterparts\n2. Create Value – Invent without committing. Float options that consider the differences between parties. \n3. Distribute Value – Behave in ways that build trust. Find objective values both parties can use to justify mutually beneficial sharing of the value created. \n4. Follow Through – Specify mechanisms to deal with predictable surprises. Agree on monitoring arrangements, including metrics. \nWhat you will learn\nThis program will help you learn to enhance your commercial relationships and achieve optimal business outcomes in a Chinese context.\nFacilitators\nAndrew Wei-Min Lee is a Fellow of Harvard Law School’s Program on Negotiation and Stanford Law School’s Gould Center for Conflict Resolution.
