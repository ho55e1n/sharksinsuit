But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><BR><\/P>\n<H3>About the speaker:<\/H3>\n<P>Professor Sanjay Subrahmayam,\u00a0Distinguished Professor &amp; Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA.\u00a0<\/P>\n<P>Sanjay Subrahmanyam<SPAN>, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford.

But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nProfessor Sanjay Subrahmayam,\u00a0Distinguished Professor & Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA.\u00a0\nSanjay Subrahmanyam, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford. Educated at the Delhi School of Economics, the first decade of his working career was spent (with brief interruptions in Philadelphia and Cambridge) teaching economic history and comparative economic development at the same institution, where he was eventually\u00a0named Professor of Economic History (1993-95). Thereafter, Subrahmanyam taught from 1995 to 2002 as Directeur d\u2019\u00e9tudes in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris),\u00a0where\u00a0his position was on the economic and social history of early modern India and the Indian Ocean world.\u00a0In 2002, Subrahmanyam was appointed as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Indian History and Culture at the University of Oxford, a position he held for two years.\nAfter joining UCLA, Subrahmanyam served from 2005 to 2011 as founding Director of UCLA's\u00a0Center for India and South Asia.\u00a0He teaches courses on medieval and early modern South Asian and Indian Ocean history, the history of European expansion, the comparative history of early modern empires, and various aspects of world history. He continues to advise graduate students on Indian history, the history of the Iberian empires, and more generally on forms of \"connected histories\".\u00a0Subrahmanyam was Joint Managing Editor of the\u00a0Indian Economic and Social History Review\u00a0for over a decade, besides serving on the boards of a number of other journals in the US, UK, France, Portugal, and elsewhere. He was also one of the founding editors of the \"South Asia Across the Disciplines (SAAD)\" monograph series.In 2013, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was elected to a Chair in Early Modern Global History at the\u00a0Coll\u00e8ge de France\u00a0in Paris, and delivered a full series of lectures there over the year 2013-14. Since 2014 he continues to lecture as a long-term visiting professor, and has a regular media presence in France:\u00a0TV interviews appear for example\u00a0on\u00a0MediaPart\u00a0(May 2014), and\u00a0on\u00a0France Info\u00a0(April 2015).\u00a0Sanjay Subrahmanyam's book\u00a0Europe's India: Words, People, Empires, 1500-1800,\u00a0appeared in 2017 from Harvard University Press, and in a French translation in 2018. Another book,\u00a0Empires Between Islam and Christianity, 1500-1800,\u00a0has appeared in 2018 in the Indian edition (Permanent Black) and the US edition in 2019.\nIn February 2019, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was awarded the Dan David Prize for History (jointly with Kenneth Pomeranz, Chicago).\u00a0","3":"Prof. Thomas\u00a0Blom\u00a0Hansen, Department of Anthropology, Stanford University\nUntil the 1970s, India\u2019s industrial and commercial economy was dominated by very small trading communities that converted their expertise and capital into modern industrial entrepreneurship. Beginning in the late 1980s, liberalization made the Indian economy vastly more dynamic but did it also transform the social basis of the private sector, or the labor market? Did a more open market also open opportunities for new groups and categories of people? Is there evidence that the high growth rates in India also break down barriers to social mobility as it has happened in other societies? Or are the deeper patterns of the Indian economy consolidating the existing distribution of opportunities, capital and employment?\n\u00a0\nContact details: Sahar Ghumkhor ghumkhor@unimelb.edu.au\u00a0\n\n","4":"Experience Indian Classical music at its finest with a mesmerizing performance by the international master of Sitar, Pt.
