Beginning in the late 1980s, liberalization made the Indian economy vastly more dynamic but did it also transform the social basis of the private sector, or the labor market? Did a more open market also open opportunities for new groups and categories of people? Is there evidence that the high growth rates in India also break down barriers to social mobility as it has happened in other societies? Or are the deeper patterns of the Indian economy consolidating the existing distribution of opportunities, capital and employment?\n\u00a0\nContact details: Sahar Ghumkhor ghumkhor@unimelb.edu.au",

In the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland, everyday militarization, violence, and the scramble for natural resources regulate the lives of Naga, Ahom, and Adivasi people, as well as migrants from elsewhere in the region, as they struggle to find peace and work.\nAnthropologist Dolly Kikon uses in-depth ethnographic accounts to address the complexity of Northeast India, a region between Southeast Asia and China where boundaries and borders are made, disputed, and maintained. Bringing a fresh and exciting direction to borderland studies, she explores the social bonds established through practices of resource extraction and the tensions these relations generate, focusing on peoples' love for the landscape and for the state, as well as for family, friends, and neighbours.\u00a0Living with Oil and Coal\u00a0illuminates questions of citizenship, social justice, and environmental politics that are shared by communities worldwide.\nAbout the author:\nDolly Kikon is a senior lecturer in the Anthropology and Development Studies Program at the University of Melbourne. She is the author of\u00a0Life and Dignity: Women's Testimonies of Sexual Violence in Dimapur (Nagaland)\u00a0and\u00a0Experiences of Naga Women in Armed Conflict: Narratives from a Militarized Society.",

        "description_text": "Keywords for India Lecture Series\nEmpire\nwith Professor Sanjay Subrahmayam\u00a0\nAbout the talk:\nTo some 'empire' in the context of India/South Asia is necessarily a reference to the British Raj, especially after 1858. But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nProfessor Sanjay Subrahmayam,\u00a0Distinguished Professor & Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA.\u00a0\nSanjay Subrahmanyam, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford. Educated at the Delhi School of Economics, the first decade of his working career was spent (with brief interruptions in Philadelphia and Cambridge) teaching economic history and comparative economic development at the same institution, where he was eventually\u00a0named Professor of Economic History (1993-95). Thereafter, Subrahmanyam taught from 1995 to 2002 as Directeur d\u2019\u00e9tudes in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris),\u00a0where\u00a0his position was on the economic and social history of early modern India and the Indian Ocean world.\u00a0In 2002, Subrahmanyam was appointed as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Indian History and Culture at the University of Oxford, a position he held for two years.\nAfter joining UCLA, Subrahmanyam served from 2005 to 2011 as founding Director of UCLA's\u00a0Center for India and South Asia.\u00a0He teaches courses on medieval and early modern South Asian and Indian Ocean history, the history of European expansion, the comparative history of early modern empires, and various aspects of world history. He continues to advise graduate students on Indian history, the history of the Iberian empires, and more generally on forms of \"connected histories\".\u00a0Subrahmanyam was Joint Managing Editor of the\u00a0Indian Economic and Social History Review\u00a0for over a decade, besides serving on the boards of a number of other journals in the US, UK, France, Portugal, and elsewhere. He was also one of the founding editors of the \"South Asia Across the Disciplines (SAAD)\" monograph series.In 2013, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was elected to a Chair in Early Modern Global History at the\u00a0Coll\u00e8ge de France\u00a0in Paris, and delivered a full series of lectures there over the year 2013-14. Since 2014 he continues to lecture as a long-term visiting professor, and has a regular media presence in France:\u00a0TV interviews appear for example\u00a0on\u00a0MediaPart\u00a0(May 2014), and\u00a0on\u00a0France Info\u00a0(April 2015).\u00a0Sanjay Subrahmanyam's book\u00a0Europe's India: Words, People, Empires, 1500-1800,\u00a0appeared in 2017 from Harvard University Press, and in a French translation in 2018. Another book,\u00a0Empires Between Islam and Christianity, 1500-1800,\u00a0has appeared in 2018 in the Indian edition (Permanent Black) and the US edition in 2019.\nIn February 2019, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was awarded the Dan David Prize for History (jointly with Kenneth Pomeranz, Chicago).",

He is a leading authority in the study of Australian perceptions of Asia.\n\u00a0\nProfessor Walker has written extensively on Australian perceptions of Asia across the period from the nineteenth century to the present. His prize-winning history, Anxious Nation: Australia and the Rise of Asia, 1850 to 1939 has just been joined by his new book, Stranded Nation: White Australia in an Asian Region published in March. \n\u00a0\nIn conversation with Professor Walker, we will discuss his new book and some of the observations that he made throughout a remarkable career as one of the most astute and respected figures in cross cultural engagement between China and Australia.  \n\u00a0\nIn addition to his extensive written works on Australia\u2019s relationship with China, Walker was also appointed as the inaugural\u00a0BHP Billiton\u00a0Professor in Australian Studies at\u00a0Peking University. An initiative of the Australia-China Council, the Foundation for Australian Studies in China, BHP Billiton, Peking University and the Australian\u00a0Department of Industry\u00a0and was the first high-profile, privately funded Australian professorial position in China. \n\u00a0\nReturning to Melbourne, he became a Director and Board of the Foundation for Australian Studies in China (FASIC). FASIC is the only not for profit private sector initiative of its kind in Australia, generously supported by BHP, and designed to promote the study of Australia in China. David is a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. \n\u00a0\nAbout the Mission\nWith a focus on Artificial Intelligence and FinTech, this trip will include opportunities to visit some of the most interesting, fast growth companies in the country. While the news is often dominated by a handful of Chinese companies well known to the West, the CATIC team have devised a program to learn from a host of lesser known yet dynamic and influential organisations across AI and entertainment, automotive, banking and finance, healthcare and education. \n\u00a0\nThis mission is an ideal opportunity for any female senior executive to better understand China\u2019s business and technology plans, as well as the history and culture that underpin them. \n\u00a0\nThis mission is not just about learning from business. It is a well-rounded program that includes the opportunity to meet with young entrepreneurs returning to China from international study and Australian trade officials on the ground facilitating connections and trade between our countries. We will also meet University students to gain a better understanding of university life and their preparations to enter the ever-changing Chinese workforce. \n\u00a0\nWhile this mission is about China, it has been designed for executive women who are keen to be informed and inspired about how Australia can shape its own future. As our economy continues to transition, this is an opportunity to move past the newspaper headlines, to invest in better understanding the history, culture and forward plans of our largest trading partner. \n\u00a0\nThe 2019 Senior Women Leader\u2019s trade mission to China hosted by China Australia Trade and Investment Council is now open for expression of interest.

        "description_text": "Assessment shock: Understanding Chinese international students' first year experiences in Australian universities\nDr Jiming Zhou, College of Foreign Languages and Literature, Fudan University\nEducation practitioners in Australian universities face an ongoing problem: how can we acculturate the large population of Chinese international students to the Australian university learning context? Join Fudan University's Dr Jiming Zhou as she discusses the concept of \u201cassessment shock\u201d as experienced by Chinese international students in their first year in Australian universities, the cognitive and socio-cultural reasons behind the shock, and the pedagogical implications for assessment design and enactment.\nThis seminar shares findings from a recent project exploring Chinese international students\u2019 perceptions and practices related to assessment tasks in the first year at Deakin University. Ten students were recruited from each of the four broad disciplinary fields most frequently studied by Chinese international students, i.e. management and commerce, engineering and related technologies, information technology, and arts and education. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted to explore students\u2019 understandings and behavior related to various assessment tasks. One unit chair/tutor from each broad discipline was also interviewed to compare and contrast the educators\u2019 perspective. \nFindings suggest prior assessment experience mediates students\u2019 perception of assessment tasks and culture. Students reported difficulties in 1) appreciating the values of some higher-order skills assessed in university contexts; 2) developing sophisticated understandings about \u201cabstract\u201d criteria; and 3) interacting with tutors about the meanings of assessment tasks and the way to move forward. \nThe seminar will conclude with discussions about how understanding \u201cassessment shock\u201d carries the potential to enhance first-year student transition and develop learner assessment literacy.\nAfter Jiming's presentation, join us for afternoon tea to continue the conversation around understanding the experiences of first-year Chinese students in Australian universities.\nThis seminar will be available across all Deakin campuses via Skype for Business (please select your location via the ticketing options for room details), and will also be accessible to all non-Deakin locations online or over the phone (please select this ticketing option for further details).\n\nJiming Zhou is a senior lecturer at Fudan University, China. She holds a PhD in education from the University of Hong Kong. Her current research interests include assessment and learning, educational innovation, and students\u2019 school-university transition.",

In 2017-18, China was by far Australia's largest trading partner, contributing $194.6 billion worth of imports and exports. This was more than the combined value of trade with Japan and the United States ($147.8 billion).\nAustralian companies are keen to take a slice of the big Chinese market pie. Local Australian business owners also want to attract attention from Chinese Australians, Chinese tourists and Chinese students in Australia. One of the questions that I was frequently asked by my clients is how to localise their brands in the Chinese context.\nIn my previous work experience in Australia, America and China, I was involved in the Chinese brand naming processes many times together with foreign companies and I understand the complexity of this sort of rebranding journey. I am happy to share with you my knowledge and previous project experience during this session, meanwhile, I am looking forward to discussing with you about your challenges or questions.\nAt this workshop, we will discuss:\n\nWhy do we need a Chinese brand name\nBasic approaches to create a Chinese naming and examples\nNaming process, tips and case sharing\nQ&A\n\nJoin us at this workshop to explore together on this interesting topic.",

        "description_text": "The post-war multilateral framework of international finance, trade and law is being changed or replaced to accommodate China\u2019s re-emergence as a great power. Within our region, China is already the greatest trading nation and is set to become the dominant provider of capital in the medium term and its laws are likely to increasingly regulate capital flows and trade.\nAll of this means that profound change is coming for Australia from the top down and the bottom up. Unless we prepare, Australia could lose real leverage in that trade and foreign policy environment. Our current approach to trade and foreign investment is market orientated, relies upon the existing multilateral framework and benefits from standard choice of law provisions that privilege familiar common law jurisdictions (i.e. England and New York). That approach will be put under increasing pressure as China\u2019s role on the world stage and within our region grows.\nChris\u2019 presentation will look at these trends, together with the impact of recent changes to Australia\u2019s laws concerning foreign investment, influence and interference, and offer some future-proofing ideas.\nBio\nChris is a partner at Gilbert + Tobin where he sits on the firm\u2019s Board and heads the firm\u2019s energy and public international law practices. He has advised government and private clients in energy, energy security and public international law in over 55 countries. In the most strategically challenging global environment in many decades, Chris\u2019 recent focus has been on Asia as that region accommodates China\u2019s re-emergence. Most recently he has advised Papua New Guinea on energy security related matters, as well as other states on maritime claims and entitlements.\nPro bono, Chris led the international legal team that worked with the Australian Government to help to secure the freedom of Australian journalist, Peter Greste, from incarceration in Egypt. He also provided support to counsel assisting to resist the capital punishment of Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia. He is a founding director of the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom.",

        "description_text": "The administration of end of life care in China differs substantially from its organisation in the West. This presentation examines how the unequal distribution of health resources and increasing economisation of the medical industry in China creates problems for access to, and the quality of, end of life care. I suggest that we first need to recognise how the language of economisation suffuses relations between ageing patients, families and medical practitioners, before tracing how socioeconomic inequalities can lead to differential experiences of end of life care. This presentation thus explores how end of life care is becoming economised in China, and how patients themselves increasingly participate in an economy of \u2018financialised human capital\u2019.\nAbout the Speaker\nDr Marc Trabsky is a Senior Lecturer at La Trobe Law School and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Health Law and Society, La Trobe University. He writes in the intersections of legal theory, history and the humanities. His research examines the\u00a0theoretical, historical and institutional arrangements of law and death. His most recent monograph is titled Law and the Dead: Technology, Relations and Institutions (Routledge, 2019).",
