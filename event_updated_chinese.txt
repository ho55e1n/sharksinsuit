An initiative of the Australia-China Council, the Foundation for Australian Studies in China, BHP Billiton, Peking University and the Australian\u00a0Department of Industry\u00a0and was the first high-profile, privately funded Australian professorial position in China. \n\u00a0\nReturning to Melbourne, he became a Director and Board of the Foundation for Australian Studies in China (FASIC). FASIC is the only not for profit private sector initiative of its kind in Australia, generously supported by BHP, and designed to promote the study of Australia in China. David is a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. \n\u00a0\nAbout the Mission\nWith a focus on Artificial Intelligence and FinTech, this trip will include opportunities to visit some of the most interesting, fast growth companies in the country. While the news is often dominated by a handful of Chinese companies well known to the West, the CATIC team have devised a program to learn from a host of lesser known yet dynamic and influential organisations across AI and entertainment, automotive, banking and finance, healthcare and education. \n\u00a0\nThis mission is an ideal opportunity for any female senior executive to better understand China\u2019s business and technology plans, as well as the history and culture that underpin them. \n\u00a0\nThis mission is not just about learning from business. It is a well-rounded program that includes the opportunity to meet with young entrepreneurs returning to China from international study and Australian trade officials on the ground facilitating connections and trade between our countries. We will also meet University students to gain a better understanding of university life and their preparations to enter the ever-changing Chinese workforce. \n\u00a0\nWhile this mission is about China, it has been designed for executive women who are keen to be informed and inspired about how Australia can shape its own future. As our economy continues to transition, this is an opportunity to move past the newspaper headlines, to invest in better understanding the history, culture and forward plans of our largest trading partner. \n\u00a0\nThe 2019 Senior Women Leader\u2019s trade mission to China hosted by China Australia Trade and Investment Council is now open for expression of interest.

        "description": "Assessment shock: Understanding Chinese international students' first year experiences in Australian universities\nDr Jiming Zhou, College of Foreign Languages and Literature, Fudan University\nEducation practitioners in Australian universities face an ongoing problem: how can we acculturate the large population of Chinese international students to the Australian university learning context? Join Fudan University's Dr Jiming Zhou as she discusses the concept of \u201cassessment shock\u201d as experienced by Chinese international students in their first year in Australian universities, the cognitive and socio-cultural reasons behind the shock, and the pedagogical implications for assessment design and enactment.\nThis seminar shares findings from a recent project exploring Chinese international students\u2019 perceptions and practices related to assessment tasks in the first year at Deakin University. Ten students were recruited from each of the four broad disciplinary fields most frequently studied by Chinese international students, i.e. management and commerce, engineering and related technologies, information technology, and arts and education. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted to explore students\u2019 understandings and behavior related to various assessment tasks. One unit chair/tutor from each broad discipline was also interviewed to compare and contrast the educators\u2019 perspective. \nFindings suggest prior assessment experience mediates students\u2019 perception of assessment tasks and culture. Students reported difficulties in 1) appreciating the values of some higher-order skills assessed in university contexts; 2) developing sophisticated understandings about \u201cabstract\u201d criteria; and 3) interacting with tutors about the meanings of assessment tasks and the way to move forward. \nThe seminar will conclude with discussions about how understanding \u201cassessment shock\u201d carries the potential to enhance first-year student transition and develop learner assessment literacy.\nAfter Jiming's presentation, join us for afternoon tea to continue the conversation around understanding the experiences of first-year Chinese students in Australian universities.\nThis seminar will be available across all Deakin campuses via Skype for Business (please select your location via the ticketing options for room details), and will also be accessible to all non-Deakin locations online or over the phone (please select this ticketing option for further details).\n\nJiming Zhou is a senior lecturer at Fudan University, China. She holds a PhD in education from the University of Hong Kong. Her current research interests include assessment and learning, educational innovation, and students\u2019 school-university transition.",

In 2017-18, China was by far Australia's largest trading partner, contributing $194.6 billion worth of imports and exports.

Local Australian business owners also want to attract attention from Chinese Australians, Chinese tourists and Chinese students in Australia. One of the questions that I was frequently asked by my clients is how to localise their brands in the Chinese context.\nIn my previous work experience in Australia, America and China, I was involved in the Chinese brand naming processes many times together with foreign companies and I understand the complexity of this sort of rebranding journey.

        "description": "The post-war multilateral framework of international finance, trade and law is being changed or replaced to accommodate China\u2019s re-emergence as a great power. Within our region, China is already the greatest trading nation and is set to become the dominant provider of capital in the medium term and its laws are likely to increasingly regulate capital flows and trade.\nAll of this means that profound change is coming for Australia from the top down and the bottom up. Unless we prepare, Australia could lose real leverage in that trade and foreign policy environment. Our current approach to trade and foreign investment is market orientated, relies upon the existing multilateral framework and benefits from standard choice of law provisions that privilege familiar common law jurisdictions (i.e. England and New York). That approach will be put under increasing pressure as China\u2019s role on the world stage and within our region grows.\nChris\u2019 presentation will look at these trends, together with the impact of recent changes to Australia\u2019s laws concerning foreign investment, influence and interference, and offer some future-proofing ideas.\nBio\nChris is a partner at Gilbert + Tobin where he sits on the firm\u2019s Board and heads the firm\u2019s energy and public international law practices. He has advised government and private clients in energy, energy security and public international law in over 55 countries. In the most strategically challenging global environment in many decades, Chris\u2019 recent focus has been on Asia as that region accommodates China\u2019s re-emergence. Most recently he has advised Papua New Guinea on energy security related matters, as well as other states on maritime claims and entitlements.\nPro bono, Chris led the international legal team that worked with the Australian Government to help to secure the freedom of Australian journalist, Peter Greste, from incarceration in Egypt. He also provided support to counsel assisting to resist the capital punishment of Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia. He is a founding director of the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom.",

        "description": "The administration of end of life care in China differs substantially from its organisation in the West. This presentation examines how the unequal distribution of health resources and increasing economisation of the medical industry in China creates problems for access to, and the quality of, end of life care. I suggest that we first need to recognise how the language of economisation suffuses relations between ageing patients, families and medical practitioners, before tracing how socioeconomic inequalities can lead to differential experiences of end of life care. This presentation thus explores how end of life care is becoming economised in China, and how patients themselves increasingly participate in an economy of \u2018financialised human capital\u2019.\nAbout the Speaker\nDr Marc Trabsky is a Senior Lecturer at La Trobe Law School and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Health Law and Society, La Trobe University. He writes in the intersections of legal theory, history and the humanities. His research examines the\u00a0theoretical, historical and institutional arrangements of law and death. His most recent monograph is titled Law and the Dead: Technology, Relations and Institutions (Routledge, 2019).",

We learn from the dragons not only in China but also in Mexico, Australia and India. Do they still have a place in our lives? Does their relation to unpredictable weather help us acknowledge the reality of climate change? Are there other ancient beliefs that may have a renewed relevance today?\nFor more information and speakers, go to our event page.\u00a0\nThe image is from Robin Best, of ceramic work made in Jingdezhen",
