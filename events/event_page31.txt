                "text": "Join us at the Melbourne School of Design for our first BE\u2014150 Dean\u2019s Lecture, where Beatriz Colomina explores the impact of medical discourse and imaging technologies on the formation, representation and reception of twentieth-century architecture. She challenges the normal understanding of modern architecture by proposing that it was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time: tuberculosis and its primary diagnostic tool, the X-ray. Modern architecture and the X-ray were born around the same time and evolved in parallel. While the X-ray exposed the inside of the body to the public eye, the modern building unveiled its interior, dramatically inverting the relationship between private and public.\u00a0Architects presented their buildings as a kind of medical instrument for protecting and enhancing the body and psyche.  Colomina traces the psychopathologies of twentieth-century architecture - from the trauma of tuberculosis to more recent disorders such as burn-out syndrome and ADHD - and the huge transformations of privacy and publicity instigated by diagnostic tools from X-Rays to MRIs and beyond. She suggests that if we want to talk about the state of architecture today, we should look to the dominant obsessions with illness and the latest techniques of imaging the body and ask what effects they have on the way we conceive architecture.\nBeatriz Colomina is an internationally renowned architectural historian and theorist who has written extensively on questions of architecture, art, technology, sexuality and media. She is Founding Director of the interdisciplinary Media and Modernity Program at Princeton University and Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the School of Architecture.

She challenges the normal understanding of modern architecture by proposing that it was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time: tuberculosis and its primary diagnostic tool, the X-ray.</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>Modern architecture and the X-ray were born around the same time and evolved in parallel.</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>While the X-ray exposed the inside of the body to the public eye, the modern building unveiled its interior, dramatically inverting the relationship between private and public.\u00a0Architects presented their buildings as a kind of medical instrument for protecting and enhancing the body and psyche. </SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>Colomina traces the psychopathologies of twentieth-century architecture - from the trauma of tuberculosis to more recent disorders such as burn-out syndrome and ADHD - and the huge transformations of privacy and publicity instigated by diagnostic tools from X-Rays to MRIs and beyond.</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>She suggests that if we want to talk about the state of architecture today, we should look to the dominant obsessions with illness and the latest techniques of imaging the body and ask what effects they have on the way we conceive architecture.</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Beatriz Colomina</STRONG> is an internationally renowned architectural historian and theorist who has written extensively on questions of architecture, art, technology, sexuality and media.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.

Anita has undertaken formal training in MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) and continually seeks to deepen her own learning and practice.\nAnita works in private practice in Moonee Ponds (Mindspire Psychology) and also consults to a variety of organisations in the areas of well-being, emotional intelligence, leadership, team development and high performance cultures.\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.
