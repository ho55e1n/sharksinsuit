While new to writing Jeanette is not new to this moving story, known to many as\u00a0the Truro murders.\u00a0\nA police commander, a parole officer, a hostel matron, a court artist and a mounted policeman - Jeanette discovered all of these key players from the seventies when she researched the story of Veronica Knight, the first victim of the serial killers in the Truro murders in South Australia. \nForty years after the discovery of her remains in the Truro bush, what started as a foster carer\u2019s story of exploration into Veronica\u2019s brief eighteen years of life, developed into a search for facts and people that took the book in an unplanned direction, uncovering long-held grief and sadness of an ever-widening circle of co-victims in this tragedy. \nJeanette\u00a0found herself confronted with the need to forgive as she wrote this narrative against a background of children in institutions, tandem serial killers, the history of parole laws and Adelaide in the 70s. No one was ever made legally accountable for Veronica\u2019s death, but this book gives her a voice and tells her story at long last.\nA voice for Veronica has been published by\u00a0Ginninderra Press and is available soon.\u00a0\nAbout the author\nJeanette Woods has always enjoyed writing, and since retiring as principal of an independent school has been able to pursue this interest. She has written for educational publications and has published her autobiography, Hardly a Conventional Trip and an essay in the Pocket Places series, Hong Kong in the 1950s. She lives with her husband on the Mornington Peninsula in Australia, with her children and nine grandchildren all close by. Jeanette shares her time between her family, her garden, travelling and writing, and leads a writers\u2019 group.\nYou can find out more about her book here on Facebook at\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/A-Voice-for-Veronica-973398556193885/\u00a0\nAbout the event\nPlease join us at\u00a0Bistro Elba\u00a0in Ocean St, Sorrento for a glass of wine\u00a0and / or\u00a0dinner or nibbles at your own expense.

While new to writing Jeanette is not new to this moving story, known to many as\u00a0the Truro murders.\u00a0<BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>A police commander, a parole officer, a hostel matron, a court artist and a mounted policeman - Jeanette discovered all of these key players from the seventies when she researched the story of Veronica Knight, the first victim of the serial killers in the Truro murders in South Australia. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Forty years after the discovery of her remains in the Truro bush, what started as a foster carer\u2019s story of exploration into Veronica\u2019s brief eighteen years of life, developed into a search for facts and people that took the book in an unplanned direction, uncovering long-held grief and sadness of an ever-widening circle of co-victims in this tragedy. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Jeanette\u00a0</SPAN>found herself confronted with the need to forgive as she wrote this narrative against a background of children in institutions, tandem serial killers, the history of parole laws and Adelaide in the 70s. No one was ever made legally accountable for Veronica\u2019s death, but this book gives her a voice and tells her story at long last.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">A voice for Veronica has been published by\u00a0<SPAN>Ginninderra Press and is available soon.\u00a0<BR></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>About the author</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Jeanette Woods has always enjoyed writing, and since retiring as principal of an independent school has been able to pursue this interest.

I just completed your DRUMBEAT facilitator training yesterday and it was excellent!!!!! The best PD I have ever done. I haven't felt so comfortable and engaged at a PD before. It was paced very well. My co-facilitator and I are already looking forward to implementing the program and excited about helping the youth we work with. Tara was a wonderful trainer and went out of her way to answer our individual questions and followed up quickly. Thank you so much Tara!!!\u00a0Sarah De Sousa Roque\n\"I just finished the Facilitator training! What an amazing experience! Geoff was an awesome trainer, fun, experienced and always available to listen to us and help us! I came home the last day and started practicing! I can't wait to start my first group! What an amazing program!\" Gretchen Marie Cabranes\nWhat is DRUMBEAT?\nWatch the video: https://youtu.be/8JJSZt2HMx4\nDRUMBEAT engages people, lifts their self-confidence and teaches a range of life-skills that will enable participants to be emotionally and socially healthy members of the community.\nUnder the guidance of a facilitator, participants develop and practice social skills such as problem-solving, active listening, empathy and tolerance through playing music with others.\nTheir learning is extended through discussion that promotes self-reflection and awareness on how their thoughts, feelings and actions impact their relationships with others.\nProgram Testimonials\n\"The games and activities which promote fun and sharing of information have been a catalyst for personal discussions and problem solving within the group. It has been rewarding to witness some students with leadership qualities, leading discussions to solve others problems in positive and supportive ways. The program has enabled some quieter students to become more assertive in this setting, which has flowed on to the classroom.\"\u00a0Janelle Wheatley, Specialist Educator, NSW\n\"A brilliant addition to my therapy toolkit, just what we need to engage young people reluctant to share their feelings.\"\u00a0Emily Harper, Clinical Psychologist WA\n\"The group had mental health, intellectual and physical disabilities, and many felt that this program would not work for them. However, I believe the group members gained a real sense of belonging. Potentially this was the only sense of belonging to something that they have ever had. They also gained a sense of contribution and recognition that they do matter; they can contribute and achieve something. The opportunity to have their voice and story heard and to take the lead really appeared to be therapeutic for the group. From observation, there were a reduction in the frequency and intensity of the behavioural incidents, an increase in communication demonstrated within the group and an increase in the sense of group cohesion and togetherness. Overall, running this group was a highlight of my career to date.\"\u00a0Angie Zappala, Behaviour Practitioner (Adults) NSW\nTo learn more about DRUMBEAT, please visit our website www.holyoake.org.au/drumbeat\nHolyoake is a not for profit organisation.
