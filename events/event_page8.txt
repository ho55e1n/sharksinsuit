The corset will be fastened using a steel busk in the front, laced in the back and have authentic materials such as spiral and steel boning. You will be able to apply the skills you learn in this workshop to other corset styles and boned garments such as evening wear.Your kit will include all materials you will need to make a corset, you will be able to choose from a selection of fabrics and embellishments and the pattern used (Laughing Moon Mercatile's Victorian Underwear (#100)) will be yours to keep.\u00a0 All you will need to bring is your sewing machine and basic sewing tools.About Your TeacherOdette has a love of sewing and a keen interest in historic fashion and social history. Combined, these interests led to some serious frustration at the difficulty in finding authentic dressmaking supplies, particularly for making historic garments.

Repetition is the mother of mastery. This, and the sense of consistency, help to pave the way to a soothed nervous system and a calm mind. These classes follow a set routine and structure that\u2019s quickly learned and beginner friendly.

He then pursued his higher education at the Vrindavan Gurukul from 1979 to 1984, where he studied all aspects of Bhakti Yoga including Bhakti Shastri and Bhakti Vaibhav, which are higher ladder of spiritual science of the soul and its creation. His father was a tantric yogi and a natural healer through mantras and plant-based medicines.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe first came to Sydney in 1984 and then started travelling around the USA and Europe from 1991.
