This has helped me to get the results I have wanted in my body. My passion has led to a career helping others to repair and transform their lives. In my experience, I found that there was a way to give my mind and body the best environment to repair. Addressing mindset, movement and nutrition I wanted to tackle my disease of Multiple Sclerosis from multiple angles, with a goal to shift the messaging of degeneration and inflammation in my body, to growth and repair pathways instead.\u00a0I want to share my findings and all the lessons I have learned over the past decade with you in these workshops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmanda's BIO\nAmanda is a Sports Kinesiologist,\u00a0Speaker\u00a0& Founder of\u00a0Bend Like Bamboo\u00a0her private practice specialising in mind-body health. Amanda specialises in autoimmune disorders, the emotional links to disease and physical stress.\u00a0Believing that flexibility builds resilience, on her own personal journey of recovery, she has learned about the power of the mind-body connection.\u00a0\n\u00a0After learning how ethically sourced, nutrient dense whole foods can significantly impact recovery, in 2014 Amanda co-founded Nourissh, an innovative meals preparation delivery company.\u00a0\n\nAt the age of 24, Amanda was diagnosed with MS. A debilitating incurable disease that renders its sufferers prone to paralysis, nerve damage and in some cases blindness. \u00a0\u00a0 \nIn 2009 Amanda suffered a major MS attack that left her paralysed down the entire left side of her body, unable to move, eat, walk or control her own body, Amanda spent two months living in rehabilitation care and was given only a 50% chance of ever walking again. With no choice but to succeed, Amanda channelled her energy into a positive force. With a mountain of determination and the aid of medical practitioners, Amanda astounded everyone by not only walking, but running.\u00a0Watch her story here\n\nAchieving an integrated approach, Amanda believes when given the right environment the mind and body can be capable of producing incredible results.\u00a0This philosophy is explored extensively at Amanda's public speaking engagements. \u00a0Amanda is a proud\u00a0Ambassador\u00a0for\u00a0MS Limited Australia\u00a0and also enjoys working with organisations to optimise performance, health and happiness.\n\u00a0\nAmanda\u2019s story\nhttps://youtu.be/yE0VA3EbzlM\nwww.amandacampbell.com.au\nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/amandacampbellspeaker\nInstagram :\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/amandacampbell_speaker/\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/AmandaC_health LinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandacampbellau\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n * Pls bring your own water bottles, notebooks and pens will be provided\n* ramp and stair access\u00a0\n*parking can be found on surrounding side streets\n\u00a0",

(Mostly the 'Repetitions' and also some variations and additional extras.)  This event is aimed at two specific groups of people:  1) Those seeking the skills to create greater satisfaction and empowerment in their connections with themselves & interactions with others - through a practice of authentic relating that is expansive and extremely effective personal development 2) Acting students wanting to deepen their practice of fluent connection with the inner depths of themselves.   Basically this short course is available to anyone who wants to learn to communicate with others and themselves more fluently, and to engage and express with greater confidence in life. It will be a chance to go on a journey of self-expression and self-discovery, and improve your presence, empathy and intuition when engaging with others. (Yes the Meisner Technque provides transferable skills to your regular life!)  We often include exploration of the foundational practices of the amazing Meisner Technique as part of the Masks & Mirrors workshop, which has run many times now, and some people seeing this new course will have attended 'Masks' one or more times.   This short course is different. It will be supported by some warm-up authentic relating practices, but mostly will be a chance to go deeper into the foundations of Meisner. To really take that journey which an afternoon event can begin to evoke, but isn't able to unfold with over time.\nThe training behind this short series is a variety of fields, including two years of intense involvement (and guest facilitation) with Meisner Melbourne.\n\nPrerequisites\nThere are now experiential pre-requisites for people who can attend all three evenings. This course is intended and priced to encourage people to attend all of them. However, for those who are super keen but can only make 1 or 2 we are also happy to have drop-in attendees (and if you can't attend the first evening it is necessary that you have at least some basic experience in Meisner or in some other formal authentic relating events). If unsure, contact us to ask :) [See email below.]  ------------------------------------------  ** AUTHENTIC RELATING & THE MEISNER TECHNIQUE **  Check out the FB event if you would like even more information:\u00a0\nwww.facebook.com/events/148453505749107------------------------------------------ BOOKINGS:   We want to encourage people to attend the whole course, so are offering an Earlybird price of $95.  From 20th May onwards price for the course will be the standard $115  Once enough people are booked we will also open bookings for single evenings at $40 each. Booking Conditions:  No refunds are available. Under exceptional circumstances you may be able to transfer your payment to a similar event.  ------------------------------------------  Stay in touch with us: E-mail: SpiralEvents00@gmail.com Mailing List for this and related Events: www.eepurl.com/iLCIr More Information: facebook.com/SpiralEvents",

To really take that journey which an afternoon event can begin to evoke, but isn't able to unfold with over time.</SPAN></SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">The training behind this short series is a variety of fields, including two years of intense involvement (and guest facilitation) with Meisner Melbourne.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Prerequisites</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>There are now experiential pre-requisites for people who can attend all three evenings. This course is intended and priced to encourage people to attend all of them. However, for those who are super keen but can only make 1 or 2 we are also happy to have drop-in attendees (and if you can't attend the first evening it is necessary that you have at least some basic experience in Meisner or in some other formal authentic relating events). If unsure, contact us to ask :) [See email below.]</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>------------------------------------------</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>** AUTHENTIC RELATING &amp; THE MEISNER TECHNIQUE **</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>Check out the FB event if you would like even more information:\u00a0</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/events/148453505749107\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN>www.facebook.com/events/148453505749107</SPAN></A><BR><BR><SPAN><SPAN>------------------------------------------</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <SPAN><SPAN>BOOKINGS: </SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>We want to encourage people to attend the whole course, so are offering an Earlybird price of $95.</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>From 20th May onwards price for the course will be the standard $115</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR> <SPAN><SPAN>Once enough people are booked we will also open bookings for single evenings at $40 each.</SPAN></SPAN><BR> <BR><SPAN><SPAN><STRONG>Booking Conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></SPAN><BR> <SPAN><SPAN>No refunds are available.

On this day communities across Victoria honour our older people, and uphold their right to live in safety, with dignity and respect. WEAAD is an opportunity to make the community aware that many older people experience mistreatment from people close to them, often their family members. \nElder abuse is any act which causes harm to an older person and is carried out by someone they know and trust, such as a family member or friend. The abuse may be physical, social, financial, psychological or sexual and can include mistreatment and neglect.
