From the Riddoch Highway / Princes Highway Roundabout (near Lady Nelson Visitor Centre, Mount Gambier), drive along the Princes Highway towards Millicent. After 12km, turn right on Kangaroo Flat Road and drive for a further 4.3 km, before turning right into Ghost Mushroom Lane. Signage\u00a0is clearly visible from the road. Ghost Mushroom Lane is not suitable for large buses, car-parking is available out the front. \n\u00a0\nAccess is via a white metal track and suitable for 2WD vehicles. We recommend parking in one of the three main car parks before exploring the trails on foot. Limited car parking is available adjacent to these walking trails. The lane way is one way and a 10km speed limit. There is also signage directing vehicles back to Mt Gambier or Glencoe. \n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nContact ForestrySA on\u00a0Phone: (08) 8724 2814\u00a0or Tour Coordinator on 0429 682 672.\n\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nPlease bring either a printed ticket, or digital copy using the email notification/Eventbrite app.\n\u00a0\nWhat is the terrain like? \nPlease be aware that Ghost Mushroom Lane is located within a working commercial pine forest and entry is undertaken at your own risk. The ground is irregular and uneven, with loose surfaces. As the Ghost Mushroom can only be seen after dark, visibility is also poor. This experience is suited to people with an average level of fitness. \n\u00a0\nWhere can I purchase merchandise?\nWant a lasting memento of your visit to Ghost Mushroom Lane? A range of glow-in-the-dark T-shirts, beanies and torches are available now. View our website to see the range or visit the Tour Guides at the laneway. Cash Only.\n\u00a0\nPhotographs and Social Media\nAs always, we encourage forest visitors to bring their cameras along to record and share their forest experience. While producing clear shots in the dead of night can be tricky, thanks to well-known local photographer and nature enthusiast Ockert le Roux, it has never been simpler. Ockert has kindly put together a technical guide to would-be photographers capture the best possible shots of the ghost mushroom. Visit our website for more information. We would love to see how much you enjoyed Ghost Mushroom Lane. Be sure to share your experience on social media and let others know about this unique opportunity.

From the Riddoch Highway / Princes Highway Roundabout (near Lady Nelson Visitor Centre, Mount Gambier), drive along the Princes Highway towards Millicent. After 12km, turn right on Kangaroo Flat Road and drive for a further 4.3 km, before turning right into Ghost Mushroom Lane. Signage\u00a0is clearly visible from the road. Ghost Mushroom Lane is not suitable for large buses, car-parking is available out the front. </SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Access is via a white metal track and suitable for 2WD vehicles. We recommend parking in one of the three main car parks before exploring the trails on foot. Limited car parking is available adjacent to these walking trails. The lane way is one way and a 10km speed limit. There is also signage directing vehicles back to Mt Gambier or Glencoe. </SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN>How can I contact the organiser with any questions?</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Contact ForestrySA on\u00a0Phone: (08) 8724 2814\u00a0or Tour Coordinator on 0429 682 672.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN>Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Please bring either a printed ticket, or digital copy using the email notification/Eventbrite app.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>What is the terrain like? </STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Please be aware that Ghost Mushroom Lane is located within a working commercial pine forest and entry is undertaken at your own risk. The ground is irregular and uneven, with loose surfaces. As the Ghost Mushroom can only be seen after dark, visibility is also poor. This experience is suited to people with an average level of fitness. </SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>\u00a0</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Where can I purchase merchandise?</STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Want a lasting memento of your visit to Ghost Mushroom Lane?

Cash Only.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>Photographs and Social Media</STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>As always, we encourage forest visitors to bring their cameras along to record and share their forest experience. While producing clear shots in the dead of night can be tricky, thanks to well-known local photographer and nature enthusiast Ockert le Roux, it has never been simpler. Ockert has kindly put together a technical guide to would-be photographers capture the best possible shots of the ghost mushroom. Visit our website for more information.

                "text": "\nHave fun creating your very own masterpiece painting with acrylic on a 40x50cm canvas without ever having painted before!\nOur artists paint along with you demonstrating step-by-step from start-to-end how to paint the featured artwork while you enjoy the relaxing experience, sipping on a glass of your favourite beverage and socialising with friends.\nIts all about Fun Art, not Fine Art!\nAnd remember, we are a BYO studio, so bring along your favourite bottle or two of liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint and sip with us on the day.\nYou supply the wine and we\u2019ll provide all the art materials, glassware and good vibes. Leave the rest to us!\nThis is not your typical painting class!\n\nFAQs\n1. What time should I arrive to my session?\nFor our evening sessions, our studio doors open at 6.40pm and painting starts sharply at 7pm. For our Sunday afternoon sessions, our studio doors open at 1.40pm and painting starts sharply at 2pm. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your session's start time and check in with our artists, pour your wine, greet your fellow paint and sippers and get your paint colours.\u00a0Our Address:\u00a0\u00a0Our South Melbourne studio is located at 206 Clarendon Street, South Melbourne, Victoria 3205, on the corner of Clarendon Street and York Street.\n\n2. What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nPublic Parking:\u00a0Public parking is available on both streets but note, parking metre fees apply at some locations during the day. Also available are the Woolworth and Aldi public parking garages located on York Street, about 50m from our studio.\nPublic Transport:\u00a0If you\u2019re catching public transport, Tram Route 12 brings you by our studio doors. Tram Stop 127 (heading into the CBD) is located in front of our studio.\n\n3. What can I bring into the event?\nWe are a BYO Studio. So, bring along your favourite liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint! A glass of wine or two helps bring out your inner artist.

                "text": "MELBOURNE - True Bone Regeneration: working with host healing\nBone regeneration can only be achieved by the patients host physiology.\nDuring this lecture delegates will examine working with host healing and how we can optimise it using a novel synthetic particulate graft material, EthOss. This material is 65% Beta-Tri Calcium Phosphate and 35% Calcium Sulphate, materials the speaker has used since 2002 in nearly 6,000 successful grafts. Both clinical and animal-based studies will be shown to exhibit the host response to the material.\nWhilst the particulate graft material EthOss is osteo-conductive, it also has osteo-inductive potential to upregulate the host healing response to regenerate new bone. These concepts originate from medical fields where there is extensive research in the importance of returning the host tissue back to its original state. This is what patients prefer (no animal or human donor material, no remnant material in the site long-term) as well as being optimal for their physiology as bone is living tissue and needs to turn over.\nEthOss was developed by a Dentist, Dr Peter Fairbairn, to suit his published protocol and is biocompatible, bacterio-static and stable. The material also fully turns over to host bone and benefits from an integrated membrane, removing the need for a separate collagen membrane.\nThe course will include a hands-on practical session with participants receiving guidance from Dr Peter Fairbairn.\nLearning Objectives\n\nTo understand host healing of hard tissue and the regenerative process\nTo value the importance of host hard tissue in the long-term stability of dental implants \nAssess the different types of particulate materials used in regeneration\nEvaluate the difference between GBR and True Bone Regeneration \n\n\u00a0About the Lecturer:\nDr Peter JM Fairbairn, is a Visiting Professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry, Mi, USA and the principal Dental Surgeon at the Scarsdale Dental Clinic, London. He has placed dental implants since 1991 and worked solely with synthetic graft materials since 2002.\nPeter is also a Honorary Life Member of the ADI (UK) and Past President of the London Dental Fellowship as well as Course Lecturer on Bone Regeneration at the Royal College of Surgeons.\nHe has many scientific papers published on Pubmed as well as chapters in two Published books on surgical protocols. He has lectured in over 40 countries globally in Conferences, Universities and Hospitals on bone regeneration. Peter is also Clinical Director of EthOss Regeneration Ltd.\n\nFAQs\nWhat shouId I bring to the event?\nYour ticket includes all course materials and equipment, handouts, background information and clinical studies, and catering for the duration of the event.\u00a0You will also receive a free box of sterile EthOss to take away with you (3x0.5cc syringes) for use after the event.\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nPlease direct all questions to Ashleigh Shaddock (ashaddock@w9.com.au) or Luvena Fawcett (luvena.fawcett@w9.com.au).\n\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nThere are no refunds due to the limited number of tickets available.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, your ticket may be transferred to another person at your practice. However, please note that the holder of the transfered ticket will not be able to collect their CPD certificate at the event. They should see Ashleigh Shaddock, EthOss product manager at W9 during the event to confirm their contact details and they will be emailed their CPD certificate separately.\n\nWhy are only 25 tickets available?\nTickets are limited so that each participant can receive individual attention as required during the practical session.\n\n\nAre CPD hours available?\nYes, 6 CPD hours are available for this event.
