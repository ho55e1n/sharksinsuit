The discussions will be facilitated by one of our highly experienced facilitators, Fiona Clarke or Merren Ricketson. Our Book Club meets on the first Thursday of each month, at 10.30am and 6.30pm. See our separate event to book for the morning session.2 May 2019Into Thin Air\u00a0By Jon Krakauer(Facilitated by\u00a0Fiona Clarke)\n\n\n\n\n\nA bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that \"suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down.\" He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer's--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for\u00a0Into Thin Air, Krakauer's epic account of the May 1996 disaster.\n\n6 June 2019Eleanor Oliphant\u00a0 is Completely FineBy Gail Honeyman(Facilitated by\u00a0Fiona Clarke)No one\u2019s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine.\u00a0Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she\u2019s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy.\u00a0But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond\u2019s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one.\n\n4 July 2019\u00a0Crime and PunishmentBy Fyodor Dostoyevsky(Facilitated by\u00a0Merren Ricketsen)\nCrime and Punishment, Russian Prestupleniye i nakazaniye, novel by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, first published in 1866. His first masterpiece, the novel is a psychological analysis of the poor former student Raskolnikov, whose theory that he is an extraordinary person able to take on the spiritual responsibility of using evil means to achieve humanitarian ends leads him to murder. The act produces nightmarish guilt in Raskolnikov. The story is one of the finest studies of the psychopathology of guilt written in any language.\n1 August 2019\u00a0Red Notice How I Became Putins\u2019s No. 1 Enemy\u00a0By Bill Browder(Facilitated by\u00a0Fiona Clarke)\nNovember 2009. An emaciated young lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, is led to a freezing isolation cell in a Moscow prison, handcuffed to a bed rail, and beaten to death by eight police officers. His crime? To testify against the Russian Interior Ministry officials who were involved in a conspiracy to steal $230 million of taxes paid to the state by one of the world's most successful hedge funds. Magnitsky's brutal killing has remained uninvestigated and unpunished to this day. His farcical posthumous show-trial brought Putin's regime to a new low in the eyes of the international community. Red Notice is a searing expose of the wholesale whitewash by Russian authorities of Magnitsky's imprisonment and murder, slicing deep into the shadowy heart of the Kremlin to uncover its sordid truths. Bill Browder - the hedge fund manager who employed Magnitsky - takes us on his explosive journey from the heady world of finance in New York and London in the 1990s, through his battles with ruthless oligarchs in the turbulent landscape of post-Soviet Union Moscow, to his expulsion from Russia on Putin's orders.\nBrowder's graphic portrait of the Russian government as a criminal enterprise wielding all the power of a sovereign state illuminates his personal transformation from financier to human rights activist, campaigning for justice for his late lawyer and friend. With fraud, bribery, corruption and torture exposed at every turn, Red Notice is a shocking but true political roller-coaster that plays out in the highest echelons of Western power.\n\n1 September 2019\u00a0The Remains of the DayBy Kazuo Ishiguru(Facilitated by\u00a0Fiona Clarke)In the summer of 1956, Stevens, a long-serving butler at Darlington Hall, decides to take a motoring trip through the West Country. The six-day excursion becomes a journey into the past of Stevens and England, a past that takes in fascism, two world wars, and an unrealised love between the butler and his housekeeper.\n\nOUR FACILITATORS\nFiona ClarkeFiona Clarke worked for many years as a Social Worker and during this time completed post graduate studies in Fine Arts at University of Melbourne.\u00a0She later completed her Secondary Teaching Diploma of Education in English and History at Monash University.\u00a0Fiona recently worked as a sessional teacher at the National Gallery of Victoria for thirteen years.\u00a0She facilitated the NGV Book club for over three years and curated two NGV Writers Festivals.\u00a0She has also been a Voluntary guide at the NGV for eighteen years.\nMerren RicketsonMerren is a English/Humanities teacher.
