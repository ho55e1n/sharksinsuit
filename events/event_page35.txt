I managed the successful program for 7 years and in this time I taught the cooking classes and trained in various school in NSW and the ACT. I saw an amazing change in both, the students and my myself which included healthier eating, the growth in core learning such as health, science, maths and literature, just to name a few. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the program and I loved seeing the students enjoy getting their hands dirty!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy passion towards healthy lifestyles lead me to being asked by Wagga Wagga High School, to mentor a year 10 student who also shared the same beliefs. in a 10 week period we compiled a healthy lifestyle book which was distributed throughout schools in wagga and to the town library, to improve healthy eating in our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Brooke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke has always had a soft spot for young children and has been highly approachable and warming towards them since a young age. Having been a Nanny for 6 years whilst living in Sydney and Wagga Wagga she has a great understanding of children's behaviour. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke was first introduced to mindfulness practices whilst studying her HSC at boarding school and continued to utilise these skills throughout University. She knows first-hand the amazing, powerful, benefits mindfulness has on your overall wellbeing especially as a young adult. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke has been a Health and Wellbeing Mentor teaching mindfulness practices to children and young adults for just over 12 months now running after school kids yoga and meditation programs and one on one sessions. The results she has seen in her students have been amazing. Students have had enhanced positivity and general outlook on life, improved mind-body connection, focus and communication, enhanced perspective, flexibility, agility and motivation. The kids have no hesitation when coming back each week. Parents have commented on how positive the program has helped this kids on a day to day basis and how nice it is to have them sharing with the whole family different yoga poses and breathing exercise. It makes it enjoyable rather then too serious. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke has ran her sessions and programs in the local correctional centre and some Riverina schools where she has worked with small groups of young children, teenagers and young adults. Brookes approach is not just about teaching mindfulness skills but she has a way of empowering and inspiring young people to have a positive outlook and live a life they love. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether the passion that both Brooke and Kim have towards mindfulness with children, has allowed them to create this exciting program that we know will deliver joy and happiness, whilst being extremely fun!!! Kids will walk away from the class calm and happy, and will learn life skills that they will use for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nNote: Facilitator is away between 17-28 April so is unable to respond to enquiries. If you wish to book yrou child in please make payment prior to term and send your receipt to brooke@soulco.com.au - any questions can be answered on Brookes return (28-29 April)\r\n",

He is also the Founding Co-Director of CAIS \u2013 the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society. Milind\u2019s research focuses on advancing AI and multiagent systems research for social good. He is an author and co-author of books on game theory and intelligent agents and is the recipient of numerous international awards and recognition, including:\n\nInternational Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI) John McCarthy Award\nACM/SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award from Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems Conference (AAMAS)\nAssociation for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Robert S Engelmore Memorial Lecture award\nINFORMS Wagner prize\nThe Rist Prize of the Military Operations Research Society\nThe Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation Homeland security award\nThe International Foundation for Agents and Multiagent Systems influential paper award\n\nMilind is also a fellow of AAAI and ACM. He has received meritorious commendation from the United States Coast Guard, Los Angeles Airport Police, and from United States Federal Air Marshals Service for pioneering real-world deployments of security games. Milind received his PhD from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.\nProfessor Ann Nicholson\nAnn Nicholson is a Professor and Deputy Dean Research in the Faculty of IT at Monash University. After completing her BSc(Hons) and MSc in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne, she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford in 1988, where she completed her doctorate in the Robotics Research Group. After completing a post-doctoral at Brown University, she returned to Australia to commence a lecturing position at Monash in 1994. Ann specialises in the broad area of Artificial Intelligence, a sub-discipline of computer science. She is a leading international researcher in the specialised area of Bayesian networks, now the dominant technology for probabilistic causal modelling in intelligent systems. She has applied Bayesian Network technology to problem-solving in many domains including meteorology, epidemiology, medicine, education and environmental science. Ann is also co-author of the well-received book \"Bayesian Artificial Intelligence\". In 2014, Ann was appointed General Chair for the major conference in her field \u2013 the 30th International Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.\nProfessor Jon Whittle\nJon Whittle is the Dean of the Faculty of IT at Monash University. He is a world-renowned expert in software engineering and human-computer interaction, with a particular interest in embedding human values in software development. He commenced as Dean in 2017 having arrived from the UK, where he was Head of the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University. Prior to this, Jon was a Senior Researcher and Technical Area Lead at NASA. Jon is an experienced research leader, having led around ten large multi-institution, multi-disciplinary research projects on the topics of digital health, innovative software development methods, the impact of digital technologies on work-life balance, social computing, and women in IT. Jon is also an award-winning educator, having received the Pilkington Teaching Award for his software design studio approach to teaching software engineering. Amongst other awards, Jon received a prestigious Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award, was nominated for a national Times Higher Education Innovation award, and won an EPSRC award for public engagement.\nAbout Monash Tech Talks\nDisruption.

                "text": "In this book, Rebecca Gidley examines the creation and operation of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), a hybrid domestic/international tribunal tasked with putting senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial. She argues that the ECCC should be considered an example of illiberal transitional justice, where the language of procedure is strongly adhered to but political considerations often rule in reality. Over more than a decade in operation, and with three people convicted, the ECCC has not contributed to the positive goals expected of transitional justice mechanisms. Through the Cambodian example, this book challenges existing assumptions and analyses of transitional justice to create a more nuanced understanding of how and why transitional justice mechanisms are employed.\n\u201cNavigating the twisting Byzantine pathways of Cambodia\u2019s opaque political system with a sure hand, Rebecca Gidley offers a subtle, nuanced reading of Cambodia\u2019s political scene. If the community of those studying transitional justice is persuaded by the arguments in this book, as well they should be, then a whole new genre of the literature will emerge which treats those illiberal examples of transitional justice.\u201d \u2013 Craig Etcheson, Harvard School of Public Health\nRebecca Gidley is a Research Fellow in the Department of Political and Social Change, at the Australian National University. She completed her PhD in history from ANU in July 2017. She has published on topics including narratives of mass atrocities, the physical location of courts, and the role of historians as expert witnesses.\nBina D\u2019Costa is Senior Fellow/Associate Professor in the Department of International Relations in the Coral Bell School. She is also the school\u2019s Deputy Director - Education. She is the author of seven books including Nationbuilding, War Crimes and Gender in South Asia.
