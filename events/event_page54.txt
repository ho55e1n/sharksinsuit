                "text": "\n\nA Celebration Day for Girls is a one-day workshop for 10-12 years old girls with their mother or female carer, designed to support girls and mothers at this special threshold in both their lives, and to provide an affirming, grounded and connected celebration of the journey to womanhood.\n\nIn the one day workshop girls enjoy lively discussion, fun activities, and hear women's experiences of menarche and growth into womanhood.\n\nMenarche (girls first period) signifies the beginning of a girl\u2019s fertile years and the menstrual cycle is an intrinsic aspect of being a woman for nearly half of her life. For many girls this is a time of embarrassment, anxiety and mixed messages about what it means to be a girl in a maturing female body. However, extensive research has shown that for young girls who experience menarche well prepared, with a positive introduction and emotional support, the result is higher self-esteem, fewer negative cycle related symptoms, favourable overall menstrual perception and easier subsequent births.\n\n\nBy celebrating menarche we give a profound message to girls that this process within her body is\nimportant and valuable, and so is she, as she learns to inhabit and navigate her changing status through her\nteenage years.\n\n\n\n\nThis event includes two sessions;\n\n- A two hour evening session with the mothers/female carer of the girls attending (Thursday May 2nd 7-9pm)- A one day workshop. (Sunday May 5th, 10am-4pm)\u00a0Attended by the girls from 10-1pm and joined by their mother/female carer from 1-4pm\n\n\n\n\nPrice for mother daughter pair for both session - $165 Full (plus booking fee)\u00a0 $125 Concession card holders (plus booking fee)\n\nVenue\nCastlemaine - TBC\n\n\n\nPlease contact facilitator Rachel Pilgrim 0430 450 967 for more information or visit www.celebrationdayforgirls.com\n\n\n\n",

This workshop is part of a series of workshops under the\u00a0Professional Practice Program umbrella. The workshop series are designed to cover\u00a0the four pillars of business:\n\nBusiness strategy and entrepreneurship;\nMarketing;\nFinance; and\nResourcing.\u00a0\n\nEach workshop in this series has been designed to be both practical and informative. The workshop format has been chosen so that you can dip into the pillar(s) of business you most need to learn about. However, you will find that you will get the maximum benefit by attending workshops across the four pillars of business.\u00a0\nBullet Proof Your\u00a0Business Finance\u00a0covers business finance for small business owners and service-based professionals. This workshop will suit those who are interested in starting their own business or professional practice, or those wanting to better-run or grow their own business/professional practice.\u00a0\nOn Sunday the 5th May, you will learn:\n\nHandling the paperwork, including the GST;\nDetermining your price and fee-setting; and\u00a0\nBudgets and cashflows.\n\nOn Sunday the 12th May, you will learn:\n\nCash flow management;\nFinancing business growth;\nAttracting external sources of funds; and\nYour wealth creation plan.\n\nBullet Proof Your Business Marketing\u00a0will be held in July.\nBullet Proof Your Business Resourcing\u00a0will be held in September.\nAdvanced strategic workshops will be held over November and early December.\u00a0\nDoors open at 9.45 a.m. for a 10.00 a.m. start.\nA range of teas and coffee are provided.\u00a0\nWho Should Attend?\nBusiness owners or private practice owners or those who aspire to setting up, running or growing their own business or private practice.\nAbout the Presenter\nHi, I believe that everyone is entitled to be the best version of themselves across the lifespan and in each domain of their lives. Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This two-day workshop is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI have also developed my own four-pillar model for teaching business and entrepreneurship skills. This two-day workshop reflects the second of the four pillars.\u00a0\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0blogs\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.\nCan I claim CPD points?\nRegistered psychologists can claim up to twelve hours of 'active' CPD. A certificate of attendance can be provided upon request.\u00a0",

Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.</P>\n<P>I have also developed my own four-pillar model for teaching business and entrepreneurship skills. This two-day workshop reflects the second of the four pillars.\u00a0</P>\n<P>I am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0</P>\n<P>You can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0<EM>blogs</EM>\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>What can I bring into the event?</STRONG></P>\n<P>You will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Yes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Is my ticket transferrable?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Yes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.</P>\n<P><STRONG>How do I get there if I am coming by public transport?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Look for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.</P>\n<P><STRONG>How can I contact the organiser with any questions?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Enquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can I claim CPD points?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Registered psychologists can claim up to twelve hours of 'active' CPD. A certificate of attendance can be provided upon request.\u00a0</P>"
