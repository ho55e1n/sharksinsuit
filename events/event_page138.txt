Internationally, there is increasing rights talk in sport. In Australia, athletes have recently raised complaints with the Australian Human Rights Commission alleging human rights breaches by domestic sporting organisations. Sporting organisations routinely subject athletes to unique legal rules that lack equivalent rights protections. Often, these unique rights approaches are said to be justifiable on the basis that sport is \u2018special\u2019 with unique priorities that must be upheld. But are they justifiable? What happens when we juxtapose existing approaches \u2013 to anti-doping, on the one hand, and athletes with differences of sex development, on the other \u2013 against one another? What differing conceptions of \u2018nature\u2019, the \u2018human\u2019, the body and the sanctity of sport, are at play? This presentation will address these issues. It asks whether Australian sporting organisations need to commit to better rights observance in their work and if so, what challenges and obstacles would need to be addressed along the way.\u00a0\nLecturer biography:\nKate Seear (LLB (Hons), BA (Hons), PhD)\u00a0is an Associate Professor in Law at the Faculty of Law, Monash University, Australia.

                "text": "Education Thought Leader Series\nDeakin University\u2019s strategic research centre in education, Research for Educational Impact (REDI), is delighted to host a public lecture series in 2019 featuring our Thought Leaders engaging with today\u2019s big questions in education.\nOur research addresses local and global challenges in education, and our Thought Leaders seek to make a difference to society and culture by engaging with today\u2019s big questions and conducting research that impacts educational theory, policy, teacher practice and student learning.\nThis inaugural lecture will be presented by Associate Professor Ly Tran, REDI Thought Leader and recently named by Forbes Vietnam among Vietnam's 50 most influential women for her research into Vietnamese higher education reform and international student mobility.\nAssociate Professor Tran has devoted her career to higher education, graduate employability, diversity and the teaching and learning of international students, with a focus on building connections between Australia and Vietnam through education.\n\nAustralian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific region: Policy setting, Practice and Future Implications\nAssociate Professor Ly Tran\nInternational student mobility is critical to Australia's social and economic development, soft diplomacy and connections with the Indo-Pacific region. \nThe number of Australian students participating in study abroad has increased sixfold over the last 10 years. About one in five Australian students undertakes study or internships overseas during their undergraduate program. \nAs a signature initiative of public diplomacy and a form of reciprocal international education, the New Colombo Plan embraces the government\u2019s commitment for young Australians to be exposed to, make connections with and learn from Indo-Pacific neighbours. By 2020, the New Colombo Plan will have sent around 40,000 Australian students to the Indo-Pacific. \nPlease join Associate Professor Ly Tran as she discusses the policy context for Australia\u2019s outbound mobility with a focus on the New Colombo Plan, and provides comparisons with some international policy settings and trends on student mobility. She will then present key findings of a Future Fellowship project funded by the Australian Research Council that explores impacts of Australian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific on student development, institutional connections, government relationships and regional engagement from the perspectives of both home and host countries. \n\n\nAssociate Professor Ly Tran\nLy Tran is an Associate Professor in the School of Education, Deakin University and is an Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellow. Ly's research focuses on international students across the school, vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) sectors, student mobility, the New Colombo Plan and staff professional learning in international education. Ly also undertakes projects on higher education, vocational education and graduate employability in Vietnam and China. Ly has been awarded five grants on international student mobility, internationalising teaching and learning and staff professional development in international education from the ARC. Ly\u2019s book, \u2018Teaching international students in vocational education: New pedagogical approaches\u2019 won the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) Excellence Award for Best Practice/Innovation in International Education (https://shop.acer.edu.au/teaching-international-students-in-vocational-education).\n\nLy has produced more than 150 publications (published and in press) in a wide range of outlets and been invited to speak at various national and international conferences on key issues related to international student experiences, student mobility, the New Colombo Plan, the teaching of international students and education in Vietnam. Ly was recently nominated as one of Vietnam's 50 most influential women by Forbes Vietnam.\n",
