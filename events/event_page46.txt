                "text": "What is the sacred? \nA Postgraduate Workshop with\u00a0Lyn McCredden \n*\nIn early 2019, a handful of Victorian state members of parliament called for a removal of \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Prayer\u201d from their daily commencement rituals. In the name of a secular and multicultural society, some MPs are calling for a replacement of the prayer with either silence, or an alternating of prayers from different faiths represented in the society. At the same time, a few conservative members of the parliament have been \u201crefusing to stand for the Indigenous \u2018Acknowledgement of Country\u2019\u201d(The Age). Australian culture is in the grip of great change: we are asking what the past means, who is responsible for past acts of violence and brutality, and how will a vision of justice emerge amongst us - politically? legally? spiritually?\n\u00a0\nIn my research across the past twenty years, I have been developing understandings of \u201cthe sacred\u201d in Australian literature and popular culture. In this paper, part of an essay written for the forthcoming Routledge Anthology New Directions in Australian Literary Studies, I will argue that one issue in Australian culture can be seen as core to future individual and communal health. What might it mean in the wider conversations around Australia\u2019s history and future self-understandings, that many Indigenous people (though certainly not all) do work and live with concepts of sacredness.  At the same time, many non-Indigenous Australians have not been able or willing to address this challenging category, let alone the multiplicity of beliefs and sacred practices existing in Australia today? While Australia is often simply designated secular (as if \u201cAustralia\u201d could be such a monolithic entity), this description neglects the diverse and increasingly influential aspects of Indigenous sacredness, as much as it turns awkwardly away from the many religious or spiritually searching writings of Indigenous, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim and other traditions, which Australia has produced across the last century.\n\nAbout the Speaker\u00a0\nLyn McCredden is Professor of Literary Studies at Deakin University. She is the author of numerous volumes of literary criticism, including James McAuley (1992), Bridgings: Reading Australian Women\u2019s Poetry (with Rose Lucas, 1996), Intimate Horizons: the Postcolonial Sacred in Australian Literature (with Frances Devlin Glass and Bill Ashcroft, 2009), and The Fiction of Tim Winton: Earthed and Sacred (2017). She has written on Indigenous Australian literature by authors Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Tony Birch, Lisa Bellear, Sam Wagan Watson; and on feminist writers such as Virginia Woolf, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Ania Walwicz, Pam Brown. She is a poet, with one volume entitled Wanting Only  (Ginninderra Press, 2018)\n ",

Eleven learners of Chinese first completed a pretest measuring their initial Chinese proficiency and a posttest after 21 days of learning Chinese on Duolingo. The application was found to be effective in improving learners\u2019 Chinese acquisition. With learner qualities such as extrinsic motivation and tech savviness being able to predict the extent of improvement from pretest to posttest. Nonetheless, motivation in general, intrinsic motivation, gamification-induced motivation, and learners\u2019 proficiency level failed to predict learners\u2019 improvement in Chinese.\n\nKayla Sarte\nMaster of General & Applied Linguistics\nThe Phrasal Complexity Development of Filipino L2 English Essays\nThis thesis examines the usage of 16 phrasal complexity features (noun modifiers) in Filipino L2 English essays across three proficiencies: low B1, high B1 and B2, and two topics. This is to test whether the hypothesized sequence of developmental stages of phrasal complexity, which is based on L1 English, still holds for L2 English writings. 64 essays from the International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English (ICNALE) were analyzed by fitting several Poisson regression models. The findings reveal a slight departure from the hypothesized developmental stages, and a stronger effect of topic on the usage of the phrasal complexity features. Implications are made theoretically, but methodological implications on the overall phrasal complexity measures are also provided.\n\nGhina Inas\nMaster of General & Applied Linguistics\nA Change Towards (t)\nThis thesis examines language variation and change in Acehnese as spoken in the Great Aceh region of Aceh Province in Indonesia. The Great Aceh variety is characterized as having word-final glottalisation in place of [t], but this appears to be undergoing a change where what would have been previously realized as [\u0294] is coming to be realised as [t]. Here, I examine this change in a corpus of sociolinguistic interviews, word lists and reading passages recorded with 34 speakers. All tokens of word-final /t/ were extracted (N=2,869, 66% [t]) and subject to regression analyses. A favouring of [t] by younger speakers indicates that this is a change in progress. Furthermore, [t] is favoured in formal speech styles, by males, and by those who have conducted university study outside Great Aceh. I conclude that the shift towards [t] is due to exposure to both Bahasa Indonesia and other Acehnese dialects in major urban centres outside Great Aceh.\n\nLauren Reed\nMaster of General & Applied Linguistics\nSituating sign language varieties of Western Highlands, PNG, within the current taxonomy of sign language types\nIn its early years, sign linguistics focused on the sign languages (SLs) of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) countries. More recently, researchers have begun to work with SLs used in more diverse situations, and we now have a typology of SL types, organised mainly along sociodemographic grounds. In 2018 I worked with 12 deaf signers in rural communities in Western Highlands province, PNG. My thesis uses four sets of data to determine where sign varieties in Western Highlands sit in the existing typology of sign languages. Namely, I consider sociolinguistic interviews with signers; wordlist elicitation; emic perspectives; and assessments and reflections on mutual intelligibility. I find that sign varieties of Western Highlands do not fit well within the existing typology, and suggest a new way of conceptualising SL use in this rural area, which has the potential to refine SL categorisation in not only this but other rural areas worldwide.\n",

This includes chemical restraint; environmental restraint; mechanical restraint; physical restraint; seclusion, and; verbal directions, or gestural conduct, of a coercive nature. The Senior Practitioner\u2019s role is to ensure that restrictive practices are planned and documented in positive behaviour support plans, they are only used as a last resort and only when necessary to prevent harm to the person or others, they are the least restrictive option available and are utilised for the shortest possible time. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Senior Practitioner, Mandy Donley is working with education and care providers, to inform and assist in developing positive behaviour support plans which ensure best practice in the ACT.

We are offering you the opportunity to come and interact with scientists in their natural habitat.\n\nSee where the science is done, whom it is done by and ask the question of why we are doing it. You will be taken on a tour through the many facets that make up the collaborative heart of this institute, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory ( assesing public health implications from microorganisms such as bacteria from humans, animals, food, water and the environment) and be able to see what a laboratory really is.\n\nHave you ever wondered where your samples go after you have been to the doctor or how to identify the bug that has caused an outbreak? Well, this is your chance. As part of the tour you will get firsthand laboratory experience to identify bugs and find out how well you wash your hands. Not to forget the Australian and international scientists that you will meet and that take you on the tour itself. Finally we will have a photo session setup so you can show others the day you were a scientist.\n\nDiscovery Tour details:\nWhen: Friday 3rd May\nTime: 4.00 for a 4.10pm Start\nTours are free and run for approximately 90 minutes. Please arrive 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.\nDress: As tour groups visit a working laboratory, closed toe shoes (preferably flat) must be worn for occupational health and safety reasons. Safety glasses will be provided.\nThe minimum age for discovery tour attendees is 12 years old. All children need to be accompanied by an adult.\nThis event is wheelchair accessible.\nPhotography: participants are welcome to take photographs during the tour, but please frame working scientists outside of the photos unless permission is given. If you do not want photos of you taken from the tour and used for the Day of immunology or by the Peter Doherty Institute, please inform us at the start of the tour.\nFor more information, contact Dr Fern Koay via hf.koay@unimelb.edu.au\n\nOther Discovery tours and events:\nOther Melbourne research institutes that are also offering tours as part of Day of Immunology in Victoria include:\n\nPeter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne\nThe Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne\nDepartment of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University at The Alfred Research Alliance, South Yarra\nThe Hudson Institute, Clayton\nLa Trobe Institute for Medical Science, Bundoora\nMurdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, Melbourne\nBiomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash, Clayton\n\n\nDay of Immunology Public Lecture:\nThe Doherty Institute is also proud to be holding the Day of Immunology Public Lecture at 6pm on the same day, details here:\u00a0 https://doipubliclecture2019.eventbrite.com.au",
