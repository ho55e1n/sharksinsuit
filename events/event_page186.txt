                "text": "\n\nHello,\nWould you like to be involved in some local science?\nMy name is Nick Gellie and I am a research scientist at the University of Adelaide. I am looking for some volunteers to assist me to plant native tubestock at Padthaway, South Australia, during July this year. All the plants are local to the area and have been specifically chosen to encourage pollinators onto adjacent agriculture.\nThe plantings form part of a four year 'Securing Pollination' project managed by Agrifutures Australia and the Rural R&D for profit program. Once mature these plantings will be used to investigate the effect restoring native vegetation can have on pollination services in agricultural landscapes.\nThe Padthaway planting day will be held on Saturday 6th of July on a mixed farming Lucerne property (map and detailed description of site access will be sent to you upon registration). We will be planting all day (9am - 5pm) however you are welcome to stay as long or as short as you like. Padthaway is apoproximately 4 hours drive from Adelaide so camping and meals will be provided for those people travelling from Adelaide. \nOnce numbers are confirmed I will be happy to arrange car pooling for those who need transport from Adelaide.\nThe planting area is flat and has easy car access. Although some lifting, bending, and kneeling will be required to complete the planting tasks so a moderate level of fitness is recommended. \nGloves, good-humour, tools, meals and snacks will be provided.\nI look forward to seeing you on the day.\nFor more information contact Nick Gellie\nmobile: 0448159203\nemail: nick.gellie@adelaide.edu.au\n\n",

This workshop is part of a series of workshops under the\u00a0Professional Practice Program umbrella. The workshop series are designed to cover\u00a0the four pillars of business:\n\nBusiness strategy and entrepreneurship;\nMarketing;\nFinance; and\nResourcing.\u00a0\n\nEach workshop in this series has been designed to be both practical and informative. The workshop format has been chosen so that you can dip into the pillar(s) of business you most need to learn about. However, you will find that you will get the maximum benefit by attending workshops across the four pillars of business.\u00a0\nBullet Proof Your\u00a0Business Marketing\u00a0covers business marketing for small business owners and service-based professionals. This workshop will suit those who are interested in starting their own business or professional practice, or those wanting to better-run or grow their own business/professional practice.\u00a0\nOn Sunday the 7th July, you will learn:\n\nPromotion strategies that work;\nYour 'product'; and\nYour USP and your niche.\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday the 14th July, you will learn:\n\nGetting your business image right;\nMarketing with confidence; and\nUseful databases for your business.\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday the 21st July, you will learn:\n\nWebsites and marketing;\nNewsletters and ezines; and\nMarketing through social media.\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday the 28th July, you will learn:\n\nWow!ng your Customers;\nUsing Marketing to Go for Business Growth;\nLiaising with the Media; and\nLobbying for Success.\n\nBullet Proof Your Business Resourcing\u00a0will be held in September.\nAdvanced strategic workshops will be held over November and early December.\u00a0\nDoors open at 9.45 a.m. for a 10.00 a.m. start.\nA range of teas and coffee are provided.\u00a0\nWho Should Attend?\nBusiness owners or private practice owners or those who aspire to setting up, running or growing their own business or private practice.\nAbout the Presenter\nHi, I believe that everyone is entitled to be the best version of themselves across the lifespan and in each domain of their lives. Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This four-day workshop is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI have also developed my own four-pillars approach to teaching business and entrepreneurship skills. This workshop is the third pillar.\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0blogs\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.\nCan I claim CPD points?\nRegistered psychologists can claim up to 24 hours of 'active' CPD. A certificate of attendance can be provided upon request.\u00a0",
