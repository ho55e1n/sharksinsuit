M. Coetzee who described her writing as \u201cSubtle, clearsighted, and compassionate\u201d.\r\nIn May 2019 Carla Guelfenbein will be an international guest at the Sydney and Auckland Writers Festivals, as well as the Humanities Research Centre on the occasion of the recent translation of her novel\u00a0In the Distance with You\u00a0(2018) by Other Press. This novel won the prestigious Alfaguara Literary Prize in 2015. The prize\u2019s jury, led by the Spanish author Javier Cercas, said: \u201cThis is a novel of literary suspense, built with great narrative skill, around a memorable female character and the power of genius. The author has managed to weave love and enigmas, with a writing which is both complex and transparent\u201d.\r\nIn the Distance with You\u00a0is centres around the suspicious death of an enigmatic fictional author Vera Sigall, a character which Guelfenbein has acknowledged is modelled on a number of significant literary women including the Jewish-Brazilian author Clarice Lispector (1920-1977). The multiple narrators and protagonists include a celebrated poet and ex-lover of Sigall, a Chilean student returning from Paris to research the author\u2019s works, and Sigall\u2019s neighbour, all through which the reader slowly approaches the writer and mystery of the novel.\r\nPlease join Thomas Nulley-Vald\u00e9s, lecturer in Spanish studies in the School of Literature, Languages, and Linguistics, for a public interview and Q&A with Carla Guelfenbein. The discussion will centre on her life, her works,\u00a0In the Distance with You, and with readings in Spanish and English of\u00a0the novel. The event will be followed by a brief cocktail reception. The interview will be conducted in English.",

The Government\u2019s response to the Inquiry provided support for a legislative overhaul of the Environment Protection Act 1970 through two phases. The first happened in October 2017, when the new Environment Protection Act 2017 was passed by Parliament. From 1 July 2018, this Act established EPA as an independent statutory authority and legislated a Governing Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Environmental Scientist. Completing the legislative overhaul is the Environment Protection Amendment Act 2018 (the Amendment Act) which amends the Environment Protection Act 2017 (the 2017 Act). The Amendment Act was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent in August 2018.\nThe Environment Protection Amendment Act is proposed to take effect in July 2020. The session will allow attendees to have their questions answered about the Act to help Victorians prepare for 2020.\nQuestions\nPlease contact\u00a0Board.Secretary@epa.vic.gov.au if you have any questions in the lead up to the event.",
