Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN><SPAN>Our courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow<SPAN> for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early</SPAN>. (<SPAN>Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!</SPAN>) </SPAN>These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN>My baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!</SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Please book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>PLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Registration and membership includes:</SPAN></P>\n<UL>\n<LI><SPAN>Approx 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments </SPAN></LI>\n<LI><SPAN><SPAN>Complimentary handout material</SPAN></SPAN></LI>\n<LI><SPAN>One-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book<EM> Breastfeeding ... naturally</EM>, valued at $35.00</SPAN></LI>\n<LI><SPAN>Introduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents</SPAN></LI>\n<LI><SPAN>One year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" </SPAN></LI>\n<LI><SPAN>50% discount on breast pump hire rates</SPAN></LI>\n</UL>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>"

It is also easy to use thanks to a range of intuitive graphical user interfaces for statistics, data mining, and interactive visualisation. It is used by a growing number of commercial and government organisations, and is also the tool of choice of elite data mining competition winners. R is open source, flexible, and customisable. Over 4,000 R packages are available as extensions to the base environment, constituting one of the largest and most up-to-date collections of cutting edge Analytics tools in the world. It is also one of the most visually spectacular and universally applicable data visualisation tools.\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people. Select your desired quantity of tickets and click \u201cAdd to cart\u201d to see the discount calculated before checkout.\nPlease contact us at enquiries@presciient.com to find out more about these special rates.\n\nCourse Outline\nThis two-day course is an introduction to the R programming language, beginning with the most basic operations of downloading and installing the environment. Participants will learn how to input and manipulate data and be instructed in all the aspects of procedural programming in R, allowing them to create their own R functions and customise code. The course will also introduce R data structures, statistical operations, the creation of R visualisations, and options for generating output from all of these to external files. It will also provide an overview of the use of packages in R, and an introduction to some of the most common data mining, interactive visualisation and integrated graphical user interface packages.\n\nWho should attend?\nThis is a practical course, suitable for existing and prospective data analysis practitioners in government and industry. Participants will be provided with a range of programmatic and user interface options for working with data in R. The course assumes no specialised statistical knowledge. Its focus is developing a practical understanding of R as a tool for business users.\n\nCourse Outcomes\nAttendees will, by the end of the course, have the basic skills, resources, guidance and confidence to immediately and self-sufficiently begin to use R in their work.\n\nCourse Instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services\n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch will be provided on both days.
