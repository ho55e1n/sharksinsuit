Students will interact with food and nutrition scientists whilst conducting and interpreting a range of laboratory tests. Schools may choose one or both of the laboratory sessions as well as take a tour of other facilities within the University.\n\nLab 1: Food Makers\nLinked to VCE Food Studies Unit 2: Food Makers.Area of Study 2: Food in the Home\nIn this experience, students will explore the three basic methods of sensory evaluation. Discrimination testing will be conducted to determine whether a difference exists between food samples. Descriptive testing will be conducted to determine the nature and intensity of attributes in food samples. Preference testing will be conducted to determine how well food samples are liked. How these tests relate to the science of judging and evaluating the quality of food by the use of the senses (taste, smell, sight, touch and hearing) will then be discussed.Our VCE School Visit Program provides Food Studies students with valuable, practical laboratory experiences that will illustrate and demonstrate the applications of important food industry principles.\n\nLab 2: Healthy and sustainable food from paddock to plate\nLinked to VCE Food Studies Unit 4: Food issues, challenges and futures.Areas of Study: Unit 4: Area of study 1 \u2013 environment and ethics & Area of study 2 \u2013 navigating food information\nIn this hands-on activity, students will track a fresh food item from paddock to plate, incorporating a variety of activities addressing sustainability, food security, food waste, labelling and health. Students will use specialised lab equipment, similar to that used in industry, to determine an item\u2019s quality, then prepare and evaluate a food product using the items that would be labelled as \u2018second grade\u2019. They will then explore packaging techniques that could be applied to their developed food product and finally, they will use specialised software to determine the products\u2019 specific nutrient content and use this along with online tools to explore writing a health claim.\n\nSession information:\nDates: Monday 17 \u2013 Friday 21 June, 2019 Monday 24 \u2013 Friday 28 June, 2019\n3 time slots available per laboratory per day: 8:00am - 10:00am; 10:30am - 12:30pm; 1:00pm - 3:00pm (times are flexible and can be adjusted if needed)Session duration: 2 hours\nCost per session: $150 +GSTNote: Maximum of 25 students per session\n\nFor more information please contact sens_enquire@deakin.edu.au or 9244 5052. \nWe look forward to seeing you there!\nSchool of Exercise and Nutrition SciencesDeakin University",

Students will interact with sport scientists whilst conducting and interpreting a range of laboratory tests. Schools may choose one or both of the laboratory sessions as well as take a tour of other facilities within the University.\n\nLab 1: Physiological assessment of exercise\nLinked to VCE Physical Education Unit 1: The Human Body in Motion, and Unit 3: Movement Skills and Energy for Physical Activity.Area of Study: How does the body produce energy?\nIn this lab, students will explore common laboratory methods to assess aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Aerobic capacity will be assessed using a progressive exercise test to exhaustion (VO2max test). Assessment of the lactate inflection point will also be discussed, which can be applied to sporting and pacing strategies. The anaerobic energy systems will be assessed using a 10s and 30s power test on a bicycle ergometer. Discussion of how these tests relate to fitness and energy system utilisation during exercise will then be discussed.\n\nLab 2: Kinematics of movement: Resistance training\nLinked to VCE Physical Education Unit 4: Training to Improve Performance.Area of Study: How is training implemented effectively to improve performance.\nIn this lab, students will instruct, perform, and analyse several foundational resistance training exercises such as the squat, deadlift and the bench press. Kinematics of movement,\u00a0including force, velocity and power output will be explored using GymAware software. Students will evaluate vertical jump performance of class members using portable force plates, and training variables used to enhance vertical jump height in gym-based settings will be explored. The principles of chronic muscle adaptation in response to resistance training will be discussed as part of this session, with a focus on integrating resistance training into athletes programs to enhance sporting performance.\n\nSession information:\nDates: Monday 17 \u2013 Friday 21 June, 2019 Monday 24 \u2013 Friday 28 June, 2019\n3 time slots available per laboratory per day: 8:00am - 10:00am; 10:30am - 12:30pm; 1:00pm - 3:00pm (times are flexible and can be adjusted if needed)Session duration: 2 hours\nCost per session: $150 +GSTNote: Maximum of 25 students per session\n\nFor more information please contact sens_enquire@deakin.edu.au or 9244 5052. \nWe look forward to seeing you there!\nSchool of Exercise and Nutrition SciencesDeakin University",

                "text": "An Advanced Scrum Master Class\nCOURSE OVERVIEW\n\n\nThe\u00a0Professional Scrum Master II\u2122\u00a0(PSM II) course is a 2-day advanced Scrum Master class designed to support Scrum Masters in their professional development. The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized\u00a0Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification\u00a0exam.\nUnlike the\u00a0Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course\u00a0which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM II is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.\nWho Should Attend\nThe Professional Scrum Master II course is an advanced course specifically designed for experienced Scrum Masters who have a thorough understanding of the Scrum framework. \u00a0It is particularly beneficial for those people with at least one year of Scrum Master experience.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nOver the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Scrum Master such as how the principles and values of Scrum help guide Scrum Masters in the decisions they make and how the Scrum Master can help change the environment of Scrum Teams, creating an environment for agility to thrive.\u00a0The Scrum Master role is complex and often, a Scrum Master must be able to apply different stances in order to be effective, such as:\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Teacher\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Facilitator\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Change Agent\n\n\nAs a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.\nAs a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent. \u00a0Throughout the class, your PST will provide\u00a0stories,\u00a0exercises, facilitation techniques (such as \u201cLiberating Structures\u201d), resources and more.\nThere will also be time in class for the Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) to provide coaching on challenges that you and\u00a0your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy Scrum.org\nScrum.org provides the highest quality Scrum training, training materials and certified Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to teach them. Our training materials are created and maintained by Scrum co-creator Ken Schwaber, Scrum.org and the community of PSTs who teach the courses, helping to ensure that they are in tune with what\u2019s happening in software development organizations and always up-to-date with the latest practices.\nProfessional Scrum Trainers bring their own style and experience to the courses, but use the same materials so that students are learning from the same content regardless of who teaches the course or where it is taught around the world. \u00a0Read more\u00a0about the differences.\nYour Trainer - Rich Visotcky\n\"It is my mission to help people leverage different perspectives and new approaches to connect with what is truly important in their situation and solve the challenges they are facing. I love to connect people with the principles behind leaner, agile processes and practices so they build elastic skills and adaptable approaches to deal with evolving challenges.\nI'm a seasoned agile trainer and coach, Professional Scrum Trainer with Scrum.org, one of two stewards for the Professional Scrum Foundations course, and Management 3.0 facilitator bringing years of experience in helping hundreds of people learn agile concepts and put them into practice in their daily work and lives.\"\n\nhttps://www.scrum.org/rich-visotcky\n\n",
