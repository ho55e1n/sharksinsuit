It engages learners at all levels and capacities in a rigorous process of examination and meaning making through a facilitated group discussion. VTS creates a safe environment whereby students are eager to participate and builds their ability to discover multiple solutions to complex problems. Through regular (monthly or more) VTS lessons improvements in students observation skills, evidentiary reasoning and speculative abilities can be measurably demonstrated. These are benefits that over time transfer to other classroom interactions and subject areas.\nOn the surface VTS appears to be very easy and simple. In this\u00a0two day program participants will themselves look carefully at selected artworks, talk about what they observe and be encouraged to support their interpretation with visual evidence. Through deeper interrogation of the method participants will have a number of opportunities to practice VTS themselves in a supportive environment. Participants state this is the most rewarding part of the program.\u00a0Teachers will learn how to be more \u2018present\u2019 or \u2018in the moment\u2019 in their teaching as well as build on their student\u2019s interpersonal skills.\u00a0Participants will leave this program ready to facilitate VTS lessons with their students in their next class.\nThe Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) pedagogy does not require specialist art knowledge or skills.\u00a0\nThis workshop is for anyone wanting a deeper undertsanding on VTS than the one-day could provide. It is suitable for: \n\nTeachers of all year levels (pre-school to tertiary) across all subject areas. \nProfessionals working to improve speech development such as EAL, people with early onset dementia or other mild cognitive impairments. \n\n\nPrevious attendees of this program are welcome to repeat to build on their Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) skills and knowledge.\u00a0\nIf you would prefer your school to be invoiced please contact Christine\u00a0chealey@mvcc.vic.gov.au with your school's purchase order number. \nSubscribe to the Incinerator Education E-News\nStudent programs to the Gallery are free: Teachers book here. \nOther dates for upcoming Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) teacher professional learning can be seen here. \nPlease read our Public Programs - Terms and Conditions prior to purchasing your ticket.\nPresenter\nChristine Healey (Curator Education and Community Learning, at the Incinerator Gallery) is an experienced Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) practitioner.

Alastair will discuss the overall process, including performance requirements and the preliminary design procedure for the structural engineer.\nConcept Design using the new TimberTech Software \u2013 Adam Jones and Paolo Lavisci, WoodSolutions\nAdam will demonstrate the Australian version of the new TimberTech software, which has the capability to perform both analysis and design of massive and lightweight timber systems. The software has been developed through a 12-month collaborative project harmonizing Eurocode with the Australian standards \u2013 it can quickly define the structure, provide sizing of the walls and floors, design the connections and print a preliminary bill of quantities.\n\u00a0Afternoon Tea and Networking\nDesign of Timber-framed Stability Elements \u2013 Kevin Berry, TTW\nThe Phoenix building in Sydney consisted of a timber-framed shear walls and a central CLT core. Kevin will discuss the technical design of the stability system, including the stiffness of timber-framed elements, achieving composite action of the CLT core, lateral load distribution and the key connections.\nDesign of Massive-timber Stability Elements \u2013\nThis presentation will examine the stability considerations for massive timber building construction including stiffness of CLT walls and floors, composite action for CLT cores, connection design (bespoke and proprietary), designing with transfer structure, 3D modelling and the optimisation of overall stability systems.\nDesign of Floor Systems \u2013 Stephen Dayus, Wesbeam\nStephen will discuss the preliminary and detailed design process for timber floor systems, including the NCC performance requirements, typical span-to-depth ratios, floor optimisation methods, computer modelling and design documentation requirements.\nDesign for Manufacture and Assembly \u2013 Nick Hewson, XLam\nWith timber buildings utilising off-site prefabricated elements, the engineer\u2019s role needs to include ensuring that the design is efficient to manufacture and build. Nick will share his broad and rich experience in this area discussing what is DfMA, how to optimize for cost effectiveness, and how to document a mass timber building, and  he will illustrate this with a number of recent case studies.\n5.00pm Finish\n\u00a0",
