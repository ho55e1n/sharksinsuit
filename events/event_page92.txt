You will gain an understanding of the different kingdoms and how to develop relationships in these worlds. You will acquire allies to work with and the skills to deal with pathologies that afflict spirits at different times and locations.\nTopics include:\n\n\nNature Spirits and Elementals: different types and places they dwell; communicating and honouring; working in co-operation\n\n\nTrees Spirits: their story; communicating; the gift of a wand\n\n\nSpirit Guardians: locating spirit houses; working with guardians\n\n\nMalign Spirits and Pathologies: identifying and healing pathologies; wounded, isolated and trapped spirits\n\n\nProtection: amulets, talismans and charms\n\n\nOfferings and Libations\n\n\nPlant Allies and Incenses\n\n\nNo previous knowledge or experience required.\n\nEnrolments now open.\nPayment options and plans available, see\u00a0our website\n\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity to learn with UK-based\u00a0Jewels Rocka of Land and Spirit, a professional geomancer working in the field. Jewels has been practicing feng shui, geomancy, counselling, astrology and shiatsu for over 25 years in many parts of the world.\u00a0Her passion for the work, and her down-to-earth and engaging teaching style makes her workshops incredibly informative and lots of fun.\n\nTake the plunge and change the way you experience the world.\nCome and join us at one of our workshops and develop your geomantic eyes.\n\nAs well as providing the theory and history underpinning geomancy, our workshops are very hands-on, so you'll come away confident to start using everything you've learnt.\nSee\u00a0our website\u00a0for more information and to see what\u00a0other workshops we have on offer.\n\nPlease note, this description is an indication of topics; we reserve the right to substitute or reprogram content and dates as necessary.\u00a0\n\n\nFAQs\n\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEmail us\u00a0via our website and we'll answer any questions you have. You can also check out the\u00a0FAQs\u00a0on our website \u2013 your question might be answered there.\n\nI don't have any experience, is this ok?\nYes.\u00a0No\u00a0prior knowledge is required for any of our workshops.\u00a0Our classes usually have students with a range of experience levels, from none whatsoever\u00a0to healers and energy workers or those with a feng shui background, and all have equally kept up with the content and been challenged to learn something new. The beauty of geomancy is that\u00a0it helps people weave together so many of their interests and knowledge areas into a rich and meaningful practice. Everyone\u2019s way of practicing geomancy becomes really unique according to their personal journey.\n\nWhat do I need to bring to the workshop?\nWe'll be in touch before the workshop with further details about the venue (getting there, PT options, parking etc.), what to bring and items that will be available to purchase (e.g. dowsing equipment if you don't have any). But usually all you need to bring along is a pen and paper, and any dowsing tools (rods or a pendulum) if you have them.\n\nWhat's the refund policy?\nOur full refund policy is outlined in our\u00a0Terms and Conditions\u00a0on our website.\nCourse fees are due in full prior to the course commencement date. The course fee includes a non-refundable deposit of 25%.\nAll registrations for this course that are cancelled 60 days or more prior to the class starting\u00a0will be refunded in full less the deposit amount. If cancellation occurs 60 days or more prior to the class starting the deposit can be transferred to another Geomancy Australia workshop.\nCourse fees are non-refundable after 60 days prior to the class starting.\nWe reserve the right to cancel the course if it does not meet the minimum enrolment numbers, or in the event of exceptional circumstances. Where cancellation occurs, we will provide (where possible) alternative dates for course delivery, or a full refund of the course fees.\nWorkshop numbers are limited. Enrolment is not guaranteed until full payment is made. In the case of concessions and instalments, if they are not paid when due we reserve the right to cancel the enrolment.\nWe reserve the right to refuse enrolment, or withdraw enrolment of anybody at any time. If this occurs and payment has been made, it will be refunded in full or pro rata, deducting payment for workshop time already completed.\n\nCan I update my registration information?\nYes, just\u00a0contact us\u00a0and let us know if any of your details change.\n\nCan I bring my child to the workshop?\nIn order not to distract the educators and other students, children (or anyone not enrolled as a student) are not to be brought to class. Some content discussed is not appropriate for minors and classes cannot be altered to avoid this.",
