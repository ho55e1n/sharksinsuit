In biology in particular, we need workflows to automate complex analyses such as DNA variant calling, RNA sequencing, and genome assembly.

If you have tried running an event, you will sympathise with the following scenario: You have had this GREAT IDEA to run an event! But, where do you start?\nKEY INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS: Understanding the ingredients you need to run successful events is the key. Having these key ingredients in the mix will ensure that you are well prepared for your event success.PRE EVENT SUCCESS AUDIT:\u00a0Just like any marketing campaign you must be clear on the purpose of your event. What are you trying to achieve?ATTRACTING IDEAL AUDIENCE:\u00a0\"Someone\", \"Everyone\", \"Anyone\" is not a person. Before planning your events you must identify who this event has been created for.Identify your ideal audience.PERFECT EVENT DESCRIPTION:\u00a0We must think of our event as a stand-alone product that is part of our marketing mix. Just like our website communicates our business vision, mission and intention to our ideal client, our event description must also communicate the details of our eventFLAWLESS EVENT EXECUTION:\u00a0Failure to plan is a plan to fail. You need to plan the execution of every detail of your events.PLANNED EVENT CALENDAR:\u00a0If you have never run an event, you are unknown to a large potential customer base. Even if you have been in business for a long time and people know your products and services. If you haven't run an event many don't yet know the value your event will deliver.PROVEN MARKETING STRATEGY:\u00a0Ultimately, the success of your event will depend on the success of your marketing efforts.
