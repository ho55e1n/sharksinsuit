If you cannot attend please let me know so i can reissue your ticket to someone else.\n\nDo you know what is in the products you use every day?\n\nDo you want to learn how can you protect your family without living in fear?\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll take you on a tour of the house and the chemicals which we generally use and I will also teach you how to make your own or what I use as a natural replacement.\n\nMany of these chemicals we are exposed to daily may be endocrine disruptors. That means they affect our endocrine system, including the production of estrogen, testosterone, and thyroid hormones, which are all very important for the proper functioning of the body, and particularly important during pregnancy and for a developing fetus.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that the average woman uses about 12 personal care products every day. Most of which have some harmful ingredients in them.\n\nAre these mainstream products safe? The short answer is no. But there are safer alternatives.\n\nThink of all of the products you spend $100\u2019s-$1000s of dollars every year on:-\n\nKitchen sprays\nOven sprays\nBathroom sprays\nToilet cleaners\nBleach\nVapour rubs\nBeauty and hygiene products\u00a0\nPerfumes\nLaundry products\n\nAnd the worst part is, they don\u2019t even have to label the ingredients on the packaging of these toxic products!\n\nAs mums we are using nearly all of these products on a daily and our kids and family are absorbing these chemicals into their skin (your biggest organ)!\n\nSo it is a real passion of mine to teach mums and women that you don\u2019t have to use all of these chemicals to have a clean home. There are so many natural alternatives that are antibacterial, antiseptic, mould killers, natural perfumes etc to keep your family safe and healthy.\n\nSo let me show you!\n\nSo this class will entail:-\n\n* Me giving you a quick overview on some of the main cleaning products you may use, and then a quick highlight of some of the ingredients so that you understand how they are affecting you.\n* A demonstration on how I make some of these products\n* Recipes for you to take home and start making and some information on green cleaning\n* A list of where I get all of my products from\n* A special gift for anyone who decides to open a doTERRA account at the class\n\nThe reason I have decided to offer this as a FREE workshop and for you not making all of these products to take home is to keep the costs down for you. To cover my costs in providing all of these products would be about $50 per person, and you may not wish to make all of the products.\u00a0\n\nI would much prefer to offer this as a free workshop and give you all of the information and links to the tools so that you can empower yourself with all of the products you need to start your low tox living journey and to support you along the way.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see you there x",

With this vision in mind, the Forum F\u00fcr Medizinsiche Fortbildung or \u2018FoMF\u2019 (which translates to \u2018Forum for Medical Education\u2019) was established.\u00a0Since that time, FOMF has stretched across the European continent to offer a network of forums in countries including\u00a0Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. In 2013 the organisation also expanded to the United States and in 2016, it branched to the United Kingdom.\nRecently in 2017, this vision expanded to Australia with the establishment of the Australian Medical Forum (AMF). AMF endeavours to provide forums around Australia which engender\u00a0these same values.

As a result of our current initiative, AMF now offers conferences via Live Stream broadcast. It is hoped that this will also provide more options for those especially serving in regional settings. Participants will still be able to earn the same number of CPD points as in-person attendees, while participating from the comfort of their homes or offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
