                "text": "Motov8ing Boys is an event for boys aged 11-17 and their parents.\nDo you worry about your son\u2019s behaviour or attitude; or maybe he needs help building his confidence?\nDoes your son struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr maybe you're tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse get no response at all?\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. Unfortunately this often leads to various problems at home, at school and with friends both on & off line.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motivating Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8?\nJohn is a youth specialist with over 27years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across South East Victoria. Through the \"Ride of Life\" & Raging Bull seminars, delivered in schools, John has helped influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nWhilst the clich\u00e9 statement \"Boys will be boys\" is a often used to explain why boys do silly things, as a personal coach/mentor and parent himself, John would rather see this statement reflect a different sentiment. John and his company, Motov8, aim to inspire boys to choose to become awesome young men rather than just accept what others say they will be. \u00a0\nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?\nMotov8ting Boys' is an event for Pre-teen and Teenage Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; to assist them to understand the power of positive attitude, develop confidence, change destructive behaviour, Identify personal potential & understand the importance of self respect & respecting others.\u00a0\nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's this same reason they don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nSo after talking with school principals, community leaders & parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking & screaming.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.\nThere will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 & KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt & road racing.\nWhat parents are saying about this event & The Rev.\nEmma Munnoch Dec 6th Perth event.\u00a0\u00a0Inspiration and hope knowing we as parents of young Male teens are not alone in this journey. We all come with a past and should not let that effect our future potential...hearing Revs story was so close to my sons experiences at school....we are committed to help make change....every school needs a opportunity like this to help boys reach their fullest potential.My son thought it was wicked and as a family that follows moto gp and rides dirt bikes can really relate to the analogies made. He also said it was like a weight lifted when our family shared an experience that was quite traumatic to us all...I am sure this night has opened the gates of communication for our son to move forward and to talk about what's been holding him back.Blake and Josh also made him feel great at the end of the night too.Well done Rev and gang.\n\nCourtney Ekenberg Dec 3rd Ringwood event.\u00a0\u00a0The best part of tonight was walking out of there and hearing my son tell me how great that was. We spoke for a good 15 minutes during our drive home, and 15 minutes is a long time for my son! He had this drive and positive attitude that had him talking about, not only his problems but what he can do to make things better. He had that feeling of reassurance that he has the ability to make a change and to be one. I'm so grateful for the time Rev gave my son after the seminar. Just enough to encourage him. We loved hearing all about his life story and the rawness to it. It was real and you just can't bet that. Thank you MotoV8 for being apart of this journey, that we (parents and teenages) are just trying to figure out.\nAnnette Sayers Dec 3rd Rinwood event.\u00a0 Wow.... I attended Motov8 boys in Ringwood tonight and as disappointed as I was that my 15 yr old didn\u2019t attend, I was truly grateful and blown away with the Rev share and the connection he made with the boys and parents in the room.\u00a0 Rev speaks from his heart, sharing his vulnerability and connecting through storytelling. This event is for boys and as much for parents. It guides parents into creating awareness into parenting, allows parents to shine a light on whats not working and gives them strategics to be able to handle raising teenagers.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s tough being a teen and it\u2019s even tougher raising one!\u201d, - REV\u00a0 \u201cIF YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS DONE, YOU WILL ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS GOT\u201d - Albert Einstein and many others.\u00a0 If you are thinking about attending one of Rev\u2019s events, NOW is the time to say YES to you and your family. DO IT for you, DO IT for your kids. DO IT for your family. We are all worth it.\u00a0 Thank you Rev, rock on, love your work.\u00a0\nFloss Cubbin Nov 17th Grafton NSW event.\u00a0Rev held a workshop in Grafton. It was completely different to what I was expecting but was exactly what young boys/ teens can relate to.\u00a0 The fact that he shares his personal experiences and is brave enough to discuss personal issues is exactly what the youth need. To know it\u2019s ok to reach out, to know that we don\u2019t always make the best choices but there is always someone there to help u out and it\u2019s never too late.\u00a0 Rev seemed very perceptive in knowing what signs to look for and had some useful strategies that can help. I would recommend one of his workshops and I\u2019m looking forward to his return next year.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again\n\nKylie Messanger Nov 13th Grafton NSW event.\u00a0 Rev... Your impact is huge not just on the kids but on the parents... Thank you for keeping it real & thank you for telling it how it is.I loved seeing the impression you had on some of those boys tonight who stood up and told you just how awesome you made them feel. You have changed their lives and empowered them in one session.That imprinted in my heart - an emotional moment and they weren't even my sons'.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for telling your story and I can't wait for the next session - we will be there for sure!Again thank you for just being you.\u00a0 Good luck with our besties in Grafton tomorrow they won't be disappointed. The word spreads quickly!\nSeona Maybery\u00a0My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2.5hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So so much to take away from this workshop.\u00a0\nSo turn off the TV, Xbox or PS4 and bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some good advice that could just change your and their lives forever.",
                "html": "<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Motov8ing Boys is an event for boys aged 11-17 and their parents.</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Do you worry about your son\u2019s behaviour or attitude; or maybe he needs help building his confidence?</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Does your son struggle to care about or see his potential?</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Or maybe you're tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse get no response at all?</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">One of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social &amp; emotional intelligence. Unfortunately this often leads to various problems at home, at school and with friends both on &amp; off line.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">If you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motivating Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Who is John McMahon from Motov8?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">John is a youth specialist with over 27years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs &amp; families across South East Victoria. Through the \"Ride of Life\" &amp; Raging Bull seminars, delivered in schools, John has helped influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Whilst the clich\u00e9 statement \"Boys will be boys\" is a often used to explain why boys do silly things, as a personal coach/mentor and parent himself, John would rather see this statement reflect a different sentiment. John and his company, Motov8, aim to inspire boys to choose to become awesome young men rather than just accept what others say they will be. \u00a0</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Why This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Motov8ting Boys' is an event for Pre-teen and Teenage Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; to assist them to understand the power of positive attitude, develop confidence, change destructive behaviour, Identify personal potential &amp; understand the importance of self respect &amp; respecting others.\u00a0</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">As parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's this same reason they don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">So after talking with school principals, community leaders &amp; parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking &amp; screaming.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">This event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">There will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 &amp; KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt &amp; road racing.<BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>What parents are saying about this event &amp; The Rev.</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Emma Munnoch Dec 6th Perth event.\u00a0\u00a0</STRONG>Inspiration and hope knowing we as parents of young Male teens are not alone in this journey. We all come with a past and should not let that effect our future potential...hearing Revs story was so close to my sons experiences at school....we are committed to help make change....every school needs a opportunity like this to help boys reach their fullest potential.<BR>My son thought it was wicked and as a family that follows moto gp and rides dirt bikes can really relate to the analogies made. He also said it was like a weight lifted when our family shared an experience that was quite traumatic to us all...I am sure this night has opened the gates of communication for our son to move forward and to talk about what's been holding him back.<BR>Blake and Josh also made him feel great at the end of the night too.<BR>Well done Rev and gang.<SPAN CLASS=\"_6spk\" ROLE=\"presentation\"></SPAN><BR></P>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_5pbx userContent _3576\">\n<P><STRONG>Courtney Ekenberg Dec 3rd Ringwood event.\u00a0</STRONG>\u00a0The best part of tonight was walking out of there and hearing my son tell me how great that was. We spoke for a good 15 minutes during our drive home, and 15 minutes is a long time for my son! He had this drive and positive attitude that had him talking about, not only his problems but what he can do to make things better. He had that feeling of reassurance that he has the ability to make a change and to be one. I'm so grateful for the time Rev gave my son after the seminar. Just enough to encourage him. We loved hearing all about his life story and the rawness to it. It was real and you just can't bet that. Thank you MotoV8 for being apart of this journey, that we (parents and teenages) are just trying to figure out.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Annette Sayers Dec 3rd Rinwood event.</STRONG>\u00a0 Wow....

It positions them to flourish despite a national rise in teenage angst, reflected in statistics that state:\n\n\nOnly 62 per cent\u00a0of girls in secondary school said they had a strong sense of wellbeing.\n\n\nMore than 55 per cent\u00a0were assessed as anxious.*\n\n\n* NAB Independent Schools Survey 2017\nIn and out of school, your girl must fight battles she may be unequipped to win: bullying, peer pressure, body image discontent, and confusion from compromising or forfeiting her identity to fit in.\nYou may have noticed she is:\n\n\nExperiencing a rough patch\n\n\nWrestling with mood swings, frustration and/or internal conflict\n\n\nStruggling to relate to you, as you are to her\n\n\nGrowing ever distant\n\n\nSearching for help to navigate life\n\n\nYou\u2019re unsure of what to do or unable to carve out time to reach out and connect.\nThe Arrive & Thrive in\u00a0Wellbeing Program offers a dedicated solution:\n2.5 days of face to face learning, fun activities and group discussions specifically designed to equip her for life's challenges.\n10th, 11th & 12th July 2019\n9:30am - 4:30pm on the 10th & 11th July 2019.\n9:30am - 12:30pm on the 12th July 2019.\n\n\nHer Girl\u2019s Circle\nYour 13 to 18-year-old will\u00a0discover\u00a0more about wellbeing,\u00a0grow\u00a0through professional mentoring and\u00a0connect\u00a0with a supportive circle of girls. Alongside them, she will enhance her personal resilience, develop her confidence and coping mechanisms for stress, anxiety and change, build positive relationships, and cultivate optimism.\nIt's an innovative approach that transforms from the inside out and promotes the\u00a0five\u00a0core elements of\u00a0wellbeing:\n\n\nPositive\u00a0emotion\n\n\nPositive engagement\n\n\nPositive relationships\n\n\nPositive meaning\n\n\nPositive achievement\n\n\n\nFull details at\u00a0http://www.deidredattoli.com/arrive-and-thrive\n\nFAQs\nWhat if my daughter is younger than 13 or older than 18?\nThe ages set are a guide only. If you feel the program would benefit your daughter, book her in. We also have a specific wellbeing program for 10 to 12-year-old girls.\n\u00a0\nShould I still book her in if she\u2019s unsure about taking part?\nAny new experience can be a little daunting. Most girls turn up feeling nervous but soon feel nurtured and included. They make new friends fast. That said, if she is adamant about not attending, please don\u2019t force her. We leave it to your discretion. Get in touch if you would like to talk this through.\n\u00a0\nWhat should she bring with her to the sessions? \nHer workbook, her journal and water. Her clothes should be comfortable, her mind open and her curiosity peaked. Fruit and snacks are provided.\n\u00a0\nDo girls attend on their own or with friends?\nMany girls attend on their own, but it can also be beneficial to attend with a friend or sibling. They can take the journey together and support each other while still making new friends.\n\u00a0\nHow many girls will be in the program?\nTo ensure an intimate and nurturing circle we take no more than 12 girls. \n\u00a0\nWhat does a typical day look like?\nSessions generally start with a time of reflection\u2014recapping key points from the previous session and ways the girls have incorporated them into their lives. Any questions are answered. We then tackle a new topic. The girls put goals and actions in place to adopt what they\u2019ve learned.\n\u00a0\nHow will she remember what she\u2019s learned? \nEvery girl receives a workbook, her learning resource packed with information, activities and links to support the evidence-based methods used, plus a journal and textas to write her reflections.\n\u00a0\nIs there public transport near the venue?\nAbsolutely. Once registered, your daughter will receive a complete guide on public transport and venue location. \n\u00a0\nHow do you know the program will help my daughter?\nWhile nothing can be completely guaranteed, the program content is evidence-based and regularly reviewed by a psychologist to ensure its content is effective, up to date and based on the latest research.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan parents come to any of the sessions?\nParents are invited to attend the final session where girls share their development journey and present their\u00a0personal vision for the future.\n\u00a0\nHow do I support my daughter during the program?\nEncourage open communication by asking if she has any questions or thoughts on what she is learning. Be calm and reassuring. Listen without interrupting. Be curious about what it all means to her and lovingly supportive. Refrain from giving advice. \n\u00a0\nCan I continue her self-development after the program ends?\nYes. We offer an additional range of self-development programs focusing on leadership, self-esteem, body image, and one-on-one coaching, tailored to her personal needs. \n\u00a0\nIs there a payment plan available?\nWe offer an early bird payment option. Please get in touch by email to discuss this.\n\u00a0\nWe live far away and would really like a closer option.\nIf you believe girls in your area would benefit from this program, please get in touch to discuss how we can make this happen. There\u2019s also the option of a customised one-to-one coaching program that takes place in person or online. \n\u00a0\nDo you refund a program?\nWe are able to issue a refund if the request is made up to two weeks before the program commences.

If you feel the program would benefit your daughter, book her in. We also have a specific wellbeing program for 10 to 12-year-old girls.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Should I still book her in if she\u2019s unsure about taking part?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Any new experience can be a little daunting. Most girls turn up feeling nervous but soon feel nurtured and included. They make new friends fast. That said, if she is adamant about not attending, please don\u2019t force her. We leave it to your discretion. Get in touch if you would like to talk this through.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>What should she bring with her to the sessions? </STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Her workbook, her journal and water. Her clothes should be comfortable, her mind open and her curiosity peaked. Fruit and snacks are provided.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Do girls attend on their own or with friends?</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Many girls attend on their own, but it can also be beneficial to attend with a friend or sibling. They can take the journey together and support each other while still making new friends.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>How many girls will be in the program?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>To ensure an intimate and nurturing circle we take no more than 12 girls. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>What does a typical day look like?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Sessions generally start with a time of reflection\u2014recapping key points from the previous session and ways the girls have incorporated them into their lives. Any questions are answered. We then tackle a new topic. The girls put goals and actions in place to adopt what they\u2019ve learned.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>How will she remember what she\u2019s learned? </STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Every girl receives a workbook, her learning resource packed with information, activities and links to support the evidence-based methods used, plus a journal and textas to write her reflections.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Is there public transport near the venue?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Absolutely. Once registered, your daughter will receive a complete guide on public transport and venue location. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>How do you know the program will help my daughter?</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>While nothing can be completely guaranteed, the program content is evidence-based and regularly reviewed by a psychologist to ensure its content is effective, up to date and based on the latest research.\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Can parents come to any of the sessions?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Parents are invited to attend the final session where girls share their development journey and present their\u00a0</SPAN>personal vision for the future.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>How do I support my daughter during the program?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Encourage open communication by asking if she has any questions or thoughts on what she is learning. Be calm and reassuring. Listen without interrupting. Be curious about what it all means to her and lovingly supportive. Refrain from giving advice. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Can I continue her self-development after the program ends?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Yes. We offer an additional range of self-development programs focusing on leadership, self-esteem, body image, and one-on-one coaching, tailored to her personal needs. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Is there a payment plan available?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>We offer an early bird payment option. Please get in touch by email to discuss this.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>We live far away and would really like a closer option.</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>If you believe girls in your area would benefit from this program, please get in touch to discuss how we can make this happen. There\u2019s also the option of a customised one-to-one coaching program that takes place in person or online. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Do you refund a program?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>We are able to issue a refund if the request is made up to two weeks before the program commences.
