Each of the aspects of the Divine Feminine and Divine Masculine reside within us. They play out in our lives in either Light or Shadow. By giving these aspects a space to be truly felt, seen, expressed and acknowledged you create divine balance -the Sacred Union within yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will delve into one Masculine God and One Feminine Goddess in each class allowing yourself to be deeply connected with this Archetype through Embodiment Meditation and then giving this Archetype breath and life to move through you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Union Oils will also be there for order.\r\n",

We will explore how each Chakra affects different aspects of our life and how we can learn to recognise what is out of balance. We will be working on developing tools to assist with recognizing certain behavioural patterns and how to tune into your higher self to receive the answers that you are seeking. This is a seven week commitment, no make-up classes will be offered.\nEach week will take you deeper into a journey of self-awareness . This is an opportunity to reconnect with your spirit and realign yourself to your true destiny. Investing time on your soul is essential if you want to become the best version of yourself. Get a deeper understanding of why you make the choices that you do and learn how to recognize the cycles that repeat in your life.   The \u2018Chakra Wisdom Meditation Circle\u2019 will build upon the \u2018Journey to Self\u2019 Workshops and allow you to venture deeper into the wisdom that already resides within you.

Against all predictions, the live-recorded classically leaning album, comprised of imaginary letters to Juliet Capulet climbed the charts worldwide. For one week only,\u00a0The Crossing Machine\u00a0will breathe new life into the album, in a stage production at The Butterfly Club.\nThe Crossing Machine\u00a0is a new Melbourne based string quartet, bringing together some of the most in demand string players in the country. Collectively, they have worked with Alice Cooper, Roger Daltrey, Elton John, Jimmy Barnes, Peter Frampton, Barry Humphries, Billy Thorpe, Guy Sebastian, Kate Ceberano and Circus Oz.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\u00a0\nNO RELIGION. NO DOGMA. NO FUNNY POSITIONS:\u00a0 This course is practical and fun with no religious elements at all. We sit in chairs, the language used is clear and modern.\nEXPERIENCED AND WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHERS:Receive guidance from experienced mindfulness teachers who have received our Mindfulness Works teacher training and partake in ongoing professional development.\n\nCOURSE TOPICS:\nWeek 1: What is Mindfulness and What are the Benefits?\nWeek 2: Mindfulness and The Thinking Mind\nWeek 3: Mindfulness and Emotions\nWeek 4: Mindfulness and Self-Compassion\n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE SUITABLE FOR?\nThis course is suitable for absolute beginners who have no or very little mindfulness and meditation experience. This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS CATHERINE OGILVY\n\nCatherine is a dedicated practitioner and teacher of mindfulness and meditation.
