Secondly, with software like AccXite, they can start streamlining their\u00a0businesses from now.\nTo encourage early adoption and reward early subscribers, AccXite is offering the software for free\u00a0until 31 Dec 2019. If you register before 15 May 2019, you can use AccXite for free until the next\u00a0year. Once you try the AccXite software, you will see how user friendly and simple it is.\n\nRegister today!\nWhy Single Touch Payroll is a bad news for premium priced software products.\u00a0There are software products that costs 10 times more than what AccXite costs. They are releasing a\u00a0cut down version of their premium products as a gateway to lure the subscribers and then move\u00a0them to their premium products that costs around $50-75 per month. This strategy would have\u00a0worked but luckily for the small businesses in Australia, AccXite is offering a very competitive high\u00a0value option that is very similar to these premium products for 1/10 of the price.\n\nCurrent Limitations of AccXite Software\nUnlike many businesses that will use marketing jargon to hide their limitations we are upfront and\u00a0honest with our software. The payroll software has not limitations and if you come across anything is\u00a0not suiting your circumstances, please let us know and we will implement in. The complementary\u00a0accounting software at this stage has 2 limitations. One is bank feeds and another one is integrations\u00a0with third party software. We will be working on the integrations and Zapier integrations will come\u00a0before end of this year. Bank feeds are time consuming and we have so many clients with other\u00a0software providers who have broken bank feeds. We will assess this and work with the banks in the\u00a0future. However, there is no set time for this.\n\nLearn more about AccXite software by visiting the website:\u00a0https://accxite.com.au\nFor questions regarding the official Launch, please contact Blanche Wang on 0423 760 103.\n\nLaunch\u00a0delivered by AccXite and Melbourne Innovation Centre:\n",
