Sissy cannot leave this town.\u2019 Shea threw his hands in the air. \u2018Listen to me, please, Odette. It\u2019s not as if your Sissy is a white girl.\u2019\nOdette Brown has lived her whole life on the fringes of a small country town. Raising her granddaughter Sissy on her own, Odette has managed to stay under the radar of the welfare authorities who are removing Aboriginal children from their communities. When the menacing Sergeant Lowe arrives in town, determined to fully enforce the law, any freedom that Odette and Sissy enjoy comes under grave threat. Odette must make an impossible choice to protect her family.\nIn The White Girl, Tony Birch has created memorable characters whose capacity for love and courage are a timely reminder of the endurance of the human spirit.\nTONY BIRCH \nTony Birch is the author of Ghost River, which won the Victorian Premier\u2019s Literary Award for Indigenous Writing and Blood, which was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. He is also the author of Shadowboxing and three short story collections, Father\u2019s Day, The Promise and Common People. In 2017 he was awarded the Patrick White Literary Award.

He lives in Melbourne and is a Senior Research Fellow at Victoria University.\nLAURA LA ROSA\nLaura La Rosa is a proud Darug woman, originally from Western Sydney, now living on Wurundjeri land. She is the founder of\u00a0creative collective,\u00a0Woolf Communications, as well as a writer, producer, and graphic designer.\u00a0\nPassionate about grassroots collectivism and storytelling, Laura's work is focussed on fostering disruptive discourse and the elevation of vital voices through various mediums.
