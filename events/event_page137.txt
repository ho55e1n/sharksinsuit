But not all start-up founders are digital natives and the abundance of tech acronyms can be really intimidating. \nIn this session we walk through Google 101. We cover off how small businesses can get started using and thriving with Google. This includes how to set-up your business on Google, encourage customer reviews and set-up a Google Paid Advertisement. \nWe dive into why Google is important and how businesses can use Google to drive customer engagement, and ultimately revue outcomes.\n\nVicky Mann is passionate problem solver of communication, marketing and organisational challenges. As the founder of V|CMO, Vicky helps organisations build frameworks for translating business objectives into customer centric marketing programs (without the cost of a full time CMO). With over 20 years\u2019 experience in sales and marketing, Vicky provides brand, digital, data and product go-to-market strategies that deliver exceptional results. \nVicky has led direct and digital marketing projects across some of Asia\u2019s largest corporate and government departments.
