Every member of our company undergoes three full days of verse training once casting is complete. Come along for this introductory morning session, meet the team and learn how to approach the Bard.\n\nParticipants will be provided with text and do not need to come with anything prepared. Auditors will be able to ask questions during and after the session but will not be able to join the actors on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBooking for participants and auditors is essential.\n\nPlease arrive at 9:30 for a 10am start.

The day gives you the opportunity to dedicate intense, distraction free focus to your research - and to meet other researchers during the breaks. You can read more\u00a0about\u00a0#MelbWriteUp\u00a0on a recent blogpost by Julia Dehm.\u00a0\nTicket caps\nAs space is limited, tickets will be capped for this event. Please consider your availability carefully before booking a ticket as not turning up will mean another person will miss out.\u00a0\nSchedule\n\n\n10.10 - 10.35 Pomo #1 (Chair #1)\n\n\n10.40 - 11.05 Pomo #2\n\n\n11.05 - 11.20\u00a0Morning tea\n\n\n11.20 - 11.45 Pomo #3 (Chair #2)\n\n\n11.50 - 12.15 Pomo #4\n\n\n12.20 - 12.45 Pomo #5\n\n\n12.45 - 2.00\u00a0Lunch\n\n\n2.00 - 2.25 Pomo #6 (Chair #3)\n\n\n2.30 - 2.55 Pomo #7\n\n\n3.00 - 3.25 Pomo #8\n\n\n3.25 - 3.45\u00a0Afternoon tea\n\n\n3.45 - 4.10 Pomo #9 (Chair #4)\n\n\n4.15 - 4.40 Pomo #10\n\n\n4.40 -\u00a0Wrap up\u00a0\n\n\nA full day of research\nAs #MelbWriteUp\u00a0is all about maximising a full day of research, all participants are strongly encouraged to stay for the whole event \u2013 start to finish. It's recommended that you make preparations in advance that can sustain your output for the whole day. While it can be challenging to write for a whole day \u2013 it's also equally rewarding when we all get to the end!\u00a0\nChairs of each session\nThree volunteers required to chair one of the sessions each, between morning tea and lunch, lunch and afternoon tea, and afternoon tea and wrap up. Chairing will involve timing the pomodoro and making sure the segments run to schedule.\u00a0\u00a0\nCoffee, tea and water\nFresh coffee and tea are available close by at cafes on Swanston Street. Water is available within the building and via vending machines.\nPower and WiFi\nPower points are available at the venue. Free WiFi is available from the EDUROAM network. If you have an affiliation with any university on this network, you should be able to access it. It's recommended that you check with your local IT support before attending the event, to make sure your settings are configured correctly.\nCatering\nCatering will not be provided on the day. It's requested that we each contribute one item towards morning tea and afternoon tea. Participants are invited to bring their own lunch on the day, or avail of local dining options in the Swanston Street area.\u00a0\nPersonal belongings\nPlease keep your personal belongings with you when leaving the venue. At times, particularly during the breaks, the room may be left unoccupied. As it is not possible to lock the room during the day, it is safest to bring your valuables with you if you're popping out.\u00a0\nAccess on the day\nIf you have any issues accessing the building or room on the day, feel free to call: 0435 659 297.\u00a0\nCancellation\nDemand for the sessions is high. If you can no longer make it, please contact Jason in advance so he can arrange to pass your place on to the next person on the waiting list.\nRegistrations for future events\nRegistrations will be for each individual event. An email will be sent to all participants and those who have expressed an interest in attending. Places will be filled on a first come, first served basis.\u00a0\nDates for 2019\n#MelbWriteUp will run every Saturday during 2019, commencing 5 January.\u00a0\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to subscribe for email updates about #MelbWriteUp, sign up to the email distribution list. You can also follow Jason on Twitter, or watch the #MelbWriteUp hashtag to keep in the loop.\nPhoto provided by\u00a0Unsplash",

                "text": "Open Garden Tours of Musk Farm, in the Daylesford region of Victoria.\n\nMusk Farm\nMusk Farm is our private property, located 6kms from the heart of Daylesford, Victoria. Our property has a beautiful history of landscape design and transformation, and our garden is a full-time\u00a0project,\u00a0with over 200 rare or difficult to obtain plantings on site.\u00a0\nWe are very proud of the beauty of our property, the amount of attention it demands year-round requires us to have a team of up to three gardeners on site daily. Every season brings an abundance of colour and highlights to its landscape design, which warrants us sharing the beauty and inspiration our garden is constantly creating outdoors.\u00a0We are now offering Open Garden\u00a0Tours to small groups of people.\u00a0\n\nOpen Garden Tours\nOur tours run on set days usually, weekends and pre-booking is a requirement. We keep our tour groups small so our visitors have the opportunity to ask for tips and have questions answered along the way. Ray Robinson will be your tour guide. Ray is a leading Daylesford Gardener with over 40 years experience both locally and internationally.\u00a0Our garden tours are designed to be educational as well as entertaining and include a 45-minute walking tour through our 14 garden rooms.\u00a0\nDevonshire tea is offered as part of your tour experience. Weather, permitting, this will be served on the North Terrace and Chestnut lawn. In winter, morning and afternoon tea will be served in the dining room and formal sitting room of the Musk Farm Homestead. If you have any concerns or enquiries the best method is via\u00a0muskfarm@bigpond.com\n\u00a0Aside from our garden tours, we also have available a\u00a0Four-Season Package comprising a tour in Winter, Autumn, Spring and Summer which is offered at a discounted rate, to enable guests to enjoy the wonderful seasonal changes that occur throughout the year. Should you wish to gift someone a general Gift Certificate this is an option for you. Please contact us at muskfarm@bigpond.com for more information.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nBring a camera, you may also require a raincoat or umbrella. Closed footwear is recommended and gumboots may be preferential if you are touring in winter.\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nYou can email muskfarm@bigpond.com with any questions prior. If time isn't on your side, visit www.muskfarm.com for more contact options.\n\nCan we bring our dog/pet with us?\nApologies but no. We don't allow pets or animals on site. We often are using a strong fertiliser or manure (dogs love rolling in blood and bone), pesticides and chemicals in the garden to treat and care for our massive range of plants and trees, not to mention the lawns we keep. Given the rarity of some of our plantings, we must ensure they get the best possible care and they have to come first. We love dogs, and our resident dog is a handful to watch and of\u00a0course\u00a0requires constant washes himself but experience has taught us that this in itself is very difficult. We love all fur babies but cannot pose a risk their health or safety.\u00a0For the safety and health of your pet, we cannot allow them on site.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nYou are welcome to email muskfarm@bigpond.com with any enquiries regarding refunds though refunds may not be guaranteed depending on the time of purchase.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nWe only have limited parking on site and advise carpooling if touring with friends. We also recommend the Daylesford Spa Country Railway which is a tourist train which runs weekends. There's a dedicated stop for Musk Farm situated a few doors down from the entrance to our property. Visit www.dscr.com.au for more details.\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nPlease dress to match the weather. In summer you may want an umbrella for shade but in the least please bring a hat. You may also require a raincoat or umbrella. Closed footwear is recommended and gumboots may be preferential in winter (for us the cooler months are May through to October).\u00a0You wouldn't want to miss some of our amazing chaster\u00a0daisies\u00a0or frilled tulips up close, so feel free to bring a camera or take photos on your phone. If you do, please tag us on social media, we love seeing other perspectives of our property and often share your photos out with others.\n\u00a0",

You are sitting in your lounge room and for the first time in a long time, you feel relaxed\u2026\nYou take a deep breath in and your house doesn\u2019t smell like dirty laundry and feet, instead, Lavender and Wild Orange. 'How on earth can it smell so good when you haven\u2019t cleaned it properly since last week or the week before' is what you\u2019re thinking.  You've got a wine in your hand and a snack in the other and they are not toddler scraps!  Surrounded by your friends, your besties, actually! Spending the afternoon with the favourites in your life whilst you learn about all things self-care and natural health. \nThis is what an oil class with me is like.  My classes aren't just a sniffathon where I'm in the corner with the cheese platter, it\u2019s an actual class where you'll feel empowered with the knowledge of natural health. Here are some things we will cover:  - natural health solutions for whatever life throws at you - serious sleeping tips as let\u2019s be honest when did you last have a good night sleep? \n- ideas for your mental health toolkit - making your own natural health products without hitting up the organic shop every month and dropping all your cash on the Dr Hauschka collection - relaxation when you don't have the time or the funds for a sneaky Maldives trip.  Sounds like it\u2019s too good to be true? Well, it isn\u2019t! I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d like to book me for a 90-minute slice of heaven that is an Essential Oils Masterclass with me?  I\u2019m travelling parts of Australia teaching class and I\u2019m locking them in for April and May.\u00a0\nJust like a person who is great at their craft, I\u2019m happy to teach a bunch of lawyers in a boardroom, rugby peeps in the grandstand and my party girls in a situation quite similar to above...  You gather the guests and provide a platter. I'll bring the oils, sample oils for your friends and a host gift for you.  Keen as a bean\u2026 Thought so!  Make some noise if you're interested and let's get it locked in.  Booking April and May in CANBERRA, YASS, ALBURY/WODONGA, GOULBOURN and NEWCASTLE area.",

Amelia has the answer!\u00a0\n\nWhat to Expect \u2026\nAmelia begins the 2-hr workshop by teaching the audience a quick way to align with Source Energy, go through a \u201cSoul Fragment Retrieval\u201d exercise and she\u2019ll conduct a \u201cDNA Activation\u201d while the audience meditates to some beautiful medicine music. This is the 30-minutes.\nOnce the audience is energetically ready to receive, Amelia will jump right in and choose an audience member to share their question / fear, in which Amelia will Channel Messages to answer.\nWhether you feel your question was answered or not, every audience member will benefit on more than an energetic level.

It\u2019ll be a great co-creating and healing workshop!\n\nWhat Amelia Does \u2026\nAs a human BEing, we all have challenges which we face in our lives and sometimes, we just need some guidance and clarity on a situation. This is were Amelia helps \u2026 She will channel messages from various sources and say the right thing at the right time, every time.\nAmelia channels 3 different higher realm energies \u2026 \u201cThe Council\u201d of the Light (think 12 different beings of all colours, shapes, sizes and races), \u201cThe Scholars\u201d (think Gregorian Chant) and \u201cThe Z\u2019s\u201d (think Lee Harris, just different ones). Amelia has 3 Guides she works with \u2026 Running with Wolves (A native American Indian Sharman Leader who was her \u201cFather\u201d in another life), Angelo the Wolf and Archangel Raphael. Each of her guides help in different ways and serve different purposes. As well as all this, Amelia can see Spirits not just of this life but that of others. She can tell you which life, the year and describe so many details, it can get overwhelming at times.\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Please understand, if you are not registered and, in the room, seated by 10:10am, you forfeit your ticket and won\u2019t be let in the room.
