                "text": "The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations (AFDO) Disability Loop project is very fortunate to have received support from the Victorian Government to run a workshop about the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) around Victoria directly for people with disability and their families.\nThis workshop was written by a team of people with disability, some who are also NDIS participants. We believe that this allows the workshop to better meet the needs of people with a lived experience of disability. This workshop has been designed to make the NDIS easier to understand. In a small, interactive session, we will cover lots of different parts of the NDIS; from knowing who is eligible to get into the NDIS, working out what support you can get from the NDIS in your NDIS Plan, to actually using the funds in your NDIS Plan to live a better life in the community.\nIf you are a parent and/or a carer of a person with disability, we encourage you to consider bringing the person with disability along to the workshop. The NDIS is about people with disability so why not bring along the person who will benefit the most? There will be opportunities for breaks and a separate space available for resting and recovering if required.\nImportantly, these workshops are only for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend.\nUnderstanding the NDIS Workshop\nThe workshop is called Understanding the NDIS. It is a 3 hour workshop, with a short break in the middle. There are 3 workshops across three days at different times; however each workshop covers the same topics.\nIncluded in the workshop is a detailed participant handbook you can take home with you, as well as 5 factsheets with even more information about the NDIS.\nDo I need to pay to attend the workshops?\nThese workshops are free for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend. If you are unsure, please contact AFDO Disability Loop first.\nIf your organisation would like to assist multiple people with disability and/or families to register, please contact AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email disabilityloop@afdo.org.au before registering.\u2028\nWill AFDO Disability Loop provide accessibility supports?\nFor AFDO Disability Loop, accessibility is a priority. All workshops are held in accessible environments with accessible bathrooms in the same venue.\nWhen registering for the workshops, there is an option to tell us your accessibility needs. For example, AFDO can provide live captioning, Auslan interpreting, material in electronic formats, and other accessibility supports when they are required.\nIf you have any specific requests not listed on the registration form, please contact us and we can assist you where possible.\nWill food be provided at the event?\nYes. For those attending a session during the middle of the day, lunch or afternoon tea will be provided. For those attending the evening session, light snacks and/or sweets will be provided.\nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nYou can call AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email\u00a0disabilityloop@afdo.org.au\u00a0\n",
