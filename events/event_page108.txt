Michelle has lived with HIV for over 29 years. She lost her husband to HIV and has experienced many levels of stigma and discrimination, none of which has stopped her. Instead it has driven Michelle to become a very passionate and vocal advocate for HIV issues. Michelle is supported by her partner, two daughters and 5 beautiful grandchildren, living on the Central Coast of NSW.\nSince her diagnosis in 1990, Michelle has spent many years working with the HIV Speakers Bureau nationally and has served on several HIV Boards and committees at both state and national levels. She currently sits on the Board of the Anwernekenhe National HIV Alliance (ANA) as the HIV-positive representative and Chair, and is also a community member and the convener of the Positive Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Network (PATSIN). She also is a member of the National Association of People With HIV Australia\u2019s (NAPWHA) Femme Fatales network. Michelle works across Australia to advocate for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander people living with HIV. She also represents the positive voice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, especially for women, on a number of advisory committees.\nLimin MaoAssociate Professor Limin Mao has been at UNSW since 1998. She has been with the Centre for Social Research in Health and its former National Centre for HIV Social Research for over 15 years. Much of her work focuses on exploring the various social aspects of preventing and managing HIV and other sexually transmissible infections in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region. Through this type of \u2018social medicine\u2019 research, her passion is to empower people often marginalised by their connection with these conditions to improve their health and social wellbeing.\nRobert GriewRobert has a long history in health and social policy and is the newly elected President of AFAO. He has run the NT Department of Health and Community Services and, prior to that the AIDS Council of NSW (now ACON). He has also worked at senior levels in higher education and research policy, aged care, early childhood and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advancement. He has previously served on AFAO\u2019s Board, along with a number of others, mostly in the social justice not-for-profit sector.\nRobert brings to AFAO a long association with the sector, a passion for advancing social justice for communities affected by disadvantage and marginalisation and a commitment to good policy. He believes in building strong coalitions both across the sector and with others.\nHe currently works as a consultant across public policy, administration and the not-for-profit sector. He has postgraduate training in public health and economics.\nWe invite all community members and allies to attend this free event.\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nThere is free parking availble at the venue via Gordon Street.

Michelle has lived with HIV for over 29 years. She lost her husband to HIV and has experienced many levels of stigma and discrimination, none of which has stopped her. Instead it has driven Michelle to become a very passionate and vocal advocate for HIV issues. Michelle is supported by her partner, two daughters and 5 beautiful grandchildren, living on the Central Coast of NSW.</P>\n<P>Since her diagnosis in 1990, Michelle has spent many years working with the HIV Speakers Bureau nationally and has served on several HIV Boards and committees at both state and national levels. She currently sits on the Board of the Anwernekenhe National HIV Alliance (ANA) as the HIV-positive representative and Chair, and is also a community member and the convener of the Positive Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Network (PATSIN). She also is a member of the National Association of People With HIV Australia\u2019s (NAPWHA) Femme Fatales network. Michelle works across Australia to advocate for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander people living with HIV.

She has been with the Centre for Social Research in Health and its former National Centre for HIV Social Research for over 15 years. Much of her work focuses on exploring the various social aspects of preventing and managing HIV and other sexually transmissible infections in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region. Through this type of \u2018social medicine\u2019 research, her passion is to empower people often marginalised by their connection with these conditions to improve their health and social wellbeing.</P>\n<P><EM><STRONG>Robert Griew</STRONG></EM><BR>Robert has a long history in health and social policy and is the newly elected President of AFAO.

Sound healing involves using instruments to create sound and vibrations to facilitate shifts in our brainwave state and entrain our brainwaves to slow our normal beta state (normal waking consciousness) to an alpha state (relaxed consciousness), theta (meditative state) and delta (deep healing or sleep).As the mind engages in active listening, the sound and its vibrations soothes the mind and relaxes the physical body. As we create these sounds and vibrational frequencies, it leaves no room for any thinking for your mind and is incredibly healing bringing us back into harmony with our own spirit.Whether you are a beginner or have an already existing meditation practice, guided sound meditations can help you access those deeper states of relaxation and invoke a more profound connection between mind body and spirit.Benefits:The sound vibrations that are produced has immense benefits-Calming the nervous systemReleasing stress\u00a0Promoting a deeper state of relaxationImproving SleepRevive and rejuvenate your mind, body and soulCost:Sound Meditation - Early Bird Admission $25Sound Meditation - General Admission $30Sound Meditation - Last Minute Door Price $39Venue:Seasons 5 Resort454 - 460 Point Cook RdPoint Cook VIC 3030Eventbrite Booking Link:\u00a0https://full-moon-sound-meditation.eventbrite.com.au*Bring along your own yoga mat, pillow, eye mask (or something to cover our eyes) and whatever else to be comfortable, e.g. water bottle, blanket or bolster.\u00a0*Please arrive 10 minutes before the event starts\ufffdI look forward to seeing you.\n\u00a0",

                "text": "There continues to be much discussion about optimal foetal positioning, and rightfully so because it is often the key to obtaining healthy vaginal births. The subject of \u2018which way the baby\u2019s face is facing\u2019 and how it can impact\u00a0labour,\u00a0has been documented in the medical literature over the centuries by midwives and doctors alike. If the baby's face is up, or at mom's symphysis pubis, it often is cited as a reason for doing a c section.\u00a0\nWith more than enough medical evidence and research to show how babies born in the posterior position or have been in a posterior position during labour has led birth workers worldwide to teach \u201cOptimal Foetal Positioning\u201d (OFP)\u00a0- a handbook by New Zealander\u2019s Jean Sutton and Pauline Scott \u2013 to pregnant women where they are taught to understand how the baby moves during labour, which positions to avoid, and which positions help turn a posterior baby.\u00a0\nTips such as not sitting in the bucket seat of a car for too long\u00a0are given, and mom\u2019s willingness to follow suit is essential. However, the emphasis on having babies positioned in the Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA) position before or at the start of labour can also trigger other insecurities, fears, exhaustion, and\u00a0interventions for mom and baby.\nMany women come to me for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) because their previous birth team missed classic signs of a posterior before and during labour including: going past due dates, mom feeling lots of limbs in front during her pregnancy and back pain during pregnancy, slow-to-start early labour, irregular contraction patterns, slow dilation with slow progress, or even rapid dilation with a slow and often difficult, if not excruciating second stage of pushing, or continuous back ache during labour and where the backaches are more intense than the contractions itself.\u00a0\nWhilst OFP has contributed to the knowledge of both pregnant mothers and birth attendants alike in enabling smoother deliveries, it also has its flaws that have not been taken into consideration such as the fact that research shows that 67% of mothers start labour with the baby in Left-Occiput-Transverse (LOT) and not Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA).\u00a0\nAlso, when we assume that LOA is the most favourable position, we do not take into consideration the different types of pelvis there is amongst women, and even if the mother has the type of pelvis that majority of women have, imbalances within the pelvis can also hinder the progress of labour.\nHaving a baby pass through the pelvis is like putting the key through the keyhole. If the key hole is rusty, there may be problems of a smooth insertion. The key may get stuck and cause difficulties turning to unlock or even removing the key. The good news is there are many things that pregnant women can do to not just help with the key \u2013 key, meaning the baby! And there is a lot more than she can do to create space within the keyhole \u2013 meaning the pelvis, for the baby to pass through.\nThis is where \u2018Optimal Maternal Positioning\u2019 (OMP) comes in. OMP is an equally important concept which has a direct impact on optimal foetal positioning. Creating a smooth path for the baby to navigate through the pelvis during labour and birth depends on the ability for the baby to work through the cardinal movements during the processes of descent and dilation. And because of this perspective, the teamwork between the mother and her baby will give her the best chance of a swifter easier delivery.\u00a0\n\u201cBringing alignment and mobility\u00a0within the mother\u2019s pelvis enables the baby\u2019s cardinal movements\u00a0to facilitate labor progress\u201d\n\nWorkshop Outline:\n\n\nWhat is Optimal Fetal Positioning (OFP)?\n\n\nShortfalls of OFP\n\n\nWhat is Optimal Maternal Positioning (OMP)?\n\n\nPelvic Alignment\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importance of pelvic alignment to enhance pelvic mobility\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols\n\n\nPelvic Mobility\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levels of the Pelvis & Cardinal Movements\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intrinsic vs Extrinsic mobility of the pelvis\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Modify the pelvic openings\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Comfort measures\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Facilitate cardinal movements\n\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocol for Pregnancy\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocols for Pregnancy\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daily Maternal Movements\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018One a Day\u2019 Pregnancy Stretches\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prenatal Bonding & Awareness\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy Discomforts & Pain\n\n\nNavigating Road Blocks\n\n\nAssessing Labor Progress\n\n\nLabor & Birth:\u00a0Learn to use these protocols to facilitate baby\u2019s cardinal movements through the various levels of the pelvis to enable labor to progress\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol\n\n\nIBPA Online Mentoring & OMP Accreditation\n\n\n\n1.

And while expertise comes with practice and continued training, data has proven that Ron Yoshimoto has developed a hugely successful program that works for students and teachers. Yoshimoto OG is appropriate for classrooms, small groups and teaching individuals; primary, elementary, intermediate, secondary, college, and adults. These classes are designed specifically for classroom teachers, tutors, reading specialists, special education teachers and home-school parents. All our Orton Gillingham (OGI) classes are limited in size to provide personal attention and direct support.\n\u00a0Extensive Materials\nOGI trainings include\u00a0all materials required for full implementation which are included in the cost of the course. Further, there will be extensive support materials provided including multiple CDs which include approxiamtely 6,000 worksheets covering the concepts of syllabication, sounds, rules and generalizations.\n\u00a0Multisensory\nYoshimoto OG teaching sessions are action oriented with auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements reinforcing each other; spelling is simultaneously taught with reading.\n\u00a0Structured, Sequential, Cumulative\nTeaching proceeds from phonemic awareness, phonics, syllable types, syllable division rules, spelling, vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension.\n\u00a0Data Driven, Flexible, Cognitive\nYoshimoto OG is data driven, diagnostic-prescriptive teaching at it\u2019s best. The teacher designs and implements lessons based on the data gathered from the individual student and/or the classroom group. The instruction is targeted at the needs of the students and paced to insure the level of mastery that supports ongoing success for all students.\u00a0 Further, the method includes targeted interventions for students who require more repetitions or intensity. The teacher always seeks to understand how an individual learns and devises appropriate teaching strategies using students\u2019 strengths, while accommodating their weaknesses.\nThis five day Yoshimoto Orton-Gillingham training will focus on a data-driven, clinical, multisensory, phonetic, teacher guided Orton-Gillingham approach to teaching reading, writing and spelling in a whole classroom, small group and one-to-one settings.\u00a0Upon completing this course participants will have acquired the skills necessary to fully implement this data-driven solution for teaching reading to all students. Teachers implementing the Yoshimoto method with fidelity are demonstrating consistent\u00a0and significant growth that is being replicated across the U.S. Perhaps more significant is that teachers love the course, the materials and the success they are seeing in their classrooms and interventions.\nThe course will cover the three levels of decoding and spelling: sound, syllable, and\u00a0morphological. With the latter, introductory morphology, the emphasis will be on increasing the vocabulary for all children \u2013 general and special education students. Further, the system supports the outcomes within the Common Core.\nNote: All training course materials, including\u00a0extensive\u00a0teacher resources, are included in the cost of the course.\nMorning tea, lunch and afternoon tea will be provided.\nSchool orders please contact Kerry Harvey via email harvey.kerry.l@edumail.vic.gov.au\n",

We offer both full-day workshops and half-day seminars. Our programs are aimed at training individuals from all walks of life, as well as organisational groups.\r\nThe training\r\nWesley LifeForce has developed quality suicide prevention training. Our Suicide Prevention Workshop is designed to teach people how to identify the signs that someone may be at risk of suicide and appropriate action to take.

Participants will learn how to input and manipulate data and be instructed in all the aspects of procedural programming in R, allowing them to create their own R functions and customise code. The course will also introduce R data structures, statistical operations, the creation of R visualisations, and options for generating output from all of these to external files. It will also provide an overview of the use of packages in R, and an introduction to some of the most common data mining, interactive visualisation and integrated graphical user interface packages.\n\nWho should attend?\nThis is a practical course, suitable for existing and prospective data analysis practitioners in government and industry. Participants will be provided with a range of programmatic and user interface options for working with data in R. The course assumes no specialised statistical knowledge. Its focus is developing a practical understanding of R as a tool for business users.\n\nCourse Outcomes\nAttendees will, by the end of the course, have the basic skills, resources, guidance and confidence to immediately and self-sufficiently begin to use R in their work.\n\nCourse Instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services\n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch will be provided on both days.
