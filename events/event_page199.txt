The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox\u00a03 to 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nComplimentary handout material \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Overview\r\nResolving ambivalence and developing motivation is a key aspect of engagement into Men\u2019s Behaviour Change (MBC) programs. Given that most men referred to programs are mandated either formally or informally through pressure from family, friends or significant others in their lives, then this is even more critical. Even those who appear willing at the start can push back once confronted with having to change behaviour.\u00a0\r\nKen McMaster (NZ) and Helen Mentha (Australia), internationally known trainers in MI, will take an exploratory approach to expand thinking and sharpen focus regarding MI concepts, skills and applications in relation to intervention in family violence. They will integrate concepts from positive psychology, cognitive science and grit to design and facilitate powerful learning experiences. Come expecting to learn something new, try something different, and walk away feeling energized and challenged.\r\nObjectives\u00a0\r\nIn this two-day workshop we will explore a nuanced approach that blends the key principles of motivational interviewing in working in the family violence field. By the end of the workshop participants will be able to:\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelop strategies to enhance engagement and retention in interventions\u00a0\r\nRespond to ambivalence and discord in participants who are mandated to attend programs\u00a0\r\nAssist participants to identify concrete change goals that relate to family wellbeing and safety\u00a0\r\nDevelop strategies to explore motivation and meaning for positive behaviour change within family relationships\u00a0\r\nIdentify how our own personal judgements may impact the work and ways to maintain and model prosocial interactions.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\u00a0\r\nPractitioners who are currently working with those who perpetrate family violence and want to significantly increase their engagement skills, including psychologists, social workers, counsellors, marriage and family therapists, substance abuse professionals, health care providers and allied professionals, criminal justice workers, educators, and peer counsellors.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPresenters\r\nKen McMaster, M.S.W.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\u00a0\nNO RELIGION.

We sit in chairs, the language used is clear and modern.\nEXPERIENCED AND WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHERS:Receive guidance from experienced mindfulness teachers who have received our Mindfulness Works teacher training and partake in ongoing professional development.\n\nCOURSE TOPICS:\nWeek 1: What is Mindfulness and What are the Benefits?\nWeek 2: Mindfulness and The Thinking Mind\nWeek 3: Mindfulness and Emotions\nWeek 4: Mindfulness and Self-Compassion\n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE SUITABLE FOR?\nThis course is suitable for absolute beginners who have no or very little mindfulness and meditation experience. This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS FIONA LEE\n\n\n\nFiona is a seasoned traveller \u2014 literally and metaphorically.\nAfter studying Environmental Science and Education, Fiona enthusiastically plunged into teaching teenagers, developing sustainable policy and practice in the government and non-government sectors. Burnt out by 33, she swapped her briefcase for a backpack. During five years of travel, Fiona studied mindfulness with many teachers and traditions around the world.\nOver 20 years, Fiona has developed her own unique approach as a therapist. She offers personal consultations, group and corporate training and retreats globally. Fiona also offers advanced practitioner training to other therapists.\u00a0\nTime alone in nature has always provided essential balance for Fiona and she chooses to live in a small town with a forest at the end of her street... (Yep, she was into forest bathing before it was a thing). As a single Mum, running her own business, Fiona is challenged to remain mindful every day. She maintains her sanity by taking micro vacations in her hammock.\nFiona is also fascinated by ancient cultures, human origins and the meaning of life. She researches, writes and presents about these things in her spare moments.\nFiona is deeply passionate, playful and practical. She loves empowering people with mindfulness and helping them to make the most of the adventure that is life. She recommends everyone buy a hammock.\nYou can learn more about Fiona at\u00a0www.fiona-lee.com\u00a0\u00a0or on Facebook; Of The Wings.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.

Burnt out by 33, she swapped her briefcase for a backpack. During five years of travel, Fiona studied mindfulness with many teachers and traditions around the world.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Over 20 years, Fiona has developed her own unique approach as a therapist. She offers personal consultations, group and corporate training and retreats globally. Fiona also offers advanced practitioner training to other therapists.<SPAN CLASS=\"x_x_Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Time alone in nature has always provided essential balance for Fiona and she chooses to live in a small town with a forest at the end of her street... (Yep, she was into forest bathing before it was a thing). As a single Mum, running her own business, Fiona is challenged to remain mindful every day. She maintains her sanity by taking micro vacations in her hammock.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Fiona is also fascinated by ancient cultures, human origins and the meaning of life. She researches, writes and presents about these things in her spare moments.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Fiona is deeply passionate, playful and practical. She loves empowering people with mindfulness and helping them to make the most of the adventure that is life.

It's been a real pleasure! Thanks, Jane.\"\r\nGeorgia Murch\u00a0Thought Leader in Designing Organisational Feedback Cultures | Author: \"Fixing Feedback\" | Keynote Speaker\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"I've spent 12 months working with Jane to grow my influence through a stronger personal brand. Jane's superpower is identifying your uniqueness and amplifying it. She will build a strong foundation and hold you accountable to the critical actions. Jane's commitment to my success was absolute; she saw more in me than I saw in myself. Because of working with Jane, I have been braver than I knew I could be. I've achieved more, faster than I thought possible. If you want to be a woman of influence, you need Jane Anderson in your life!\"\r\nDr. Emily Verstege\u00a0Mentee | Customer Experience Expert | Speaker | Author | Mentor\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Before working with Jane Anderson I was really doubting my choice to run a business. Despite having the skills and knowledge to create amazing work for my clients I just wasn't able to translate that into a successful business. Jane has shown me how to connect with my audience in a way that suits them and builds trust. She has also shown me how to effectively nurture existing business relationships to grow my business quickly.\r\nIt's now 4 days into the new month and I have only 3 days of availability left to book in. On top of that my average sale has increased by 25% to 100%. And that is not from simply increasing prices, it's from being able to communicate with my clients on what services I can provide to them, it's educating them on what is best for their business and on how to leverage their time and investment with me.\"\r\nKerrin Smith\u00a0Client | Photography Expert",

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.

This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS KAREN BRADFORD\u00a0\n\nKaren came to meditation and mindfulness in 1994 when going through a very difficult time in her life. She\u00a0began studying and practising mindfulness, meditation and yoga.\nThese practices had such a profound and extraordinary impact in her life that she wanted\u00a0to share these skills with others. So 10\u00a0years ago, Karen studied to become a Meditation and Yoga teacher and currently runs a successful Yoga and meditation business.\nKaren\u2019s background in science (Registered Nurse) led her to explore and look for evidence-based mindfulness practice. She began studying Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) with Dr Russ Harris (author of\u00a0The Happiness Trap), the\u00a0basis of which is mindfulness practice.\nShe was looking for a way to make these valuable skills accessible to everyone without having to be traditionally interested in spirituality; bridging the gap between science and spirituality.\nKaren also works in the corporate world, training health professionals to become coaches. She is able to deliver a perfect balance to this world using mindfulness practices\u00a0and\u00a0combines a wealth of training delivery experience into high-performance group facilitation.\nKaren keenly continues her own personal journey and is currently studying with Dr Joe Dispenza (author of\u00a0Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind) who uses the latest findings from the fields of neuroscience and quantum physics to not only heal illness but also to enjoy a more fulfilled and happy life through meditation\nKaren has a great love for learning, applying and teaching and is very excited about sharing these skills with you.\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.
