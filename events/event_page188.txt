The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is received or the crisis resolves. Mental health first aid strategies are taught in evidence-based training programs authored by Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)\u00a0Australia and conducted by accredited MHFA Instructors across Australia.\nThe Youth Mental Health First Aid Course is for adults working or living with adolescents (those aged between 12 and 18 years), however, the course can be relevant for those helping people who are a little younger or older.\u00a0This course is particularly suitable for parents, teachers, sports coaches, and youth workers.\n\nWhat the course covers:\nThe course teaches adults how to assist adolescents who are developing a mental health problem or in a mental health crisis. Course participants learn about adolescent development, the signs and symptoms of the common and disabling mental health problems in young people, where and how to get help when a young person is developing a mental illness, what sort of help has been shown by research to be effective, and how to provide first aid in a crisis situation.\u00a0\n\nDeveloping mental health problems covered are:\n\u2022 Depression\n\u2022 Anxiety problems\n\u2022 Psychosis\n\u2022 Substance use problems\n\u2022 Eating disorders\n\nMental health crisis situations covered are:\n\u2022 Suicidal thoughts and behaviours\n\u2022 Non-suicidal self-injury (sometimes called deliberate self-harm)\n\u2022 Panic attacks\n\u2022 Traumatic events\n\u2022 Severe effects of drug or alcohol use\n\u2022 Severe psychotic states\n\u2022 Aggressive behaviours\n\nFormat\nThis is a 14 hour course, 2-day training package (7 hours per day)\nCourse participants receive a copy of the Youth MHFA Manual to keep and a Certificate of Completion.\nYouth MHFA Manual\nA manual is provided to each participant attending this 14-hour MHFA course.\nOn the day what do you need to bring?\nJust a pen and yourself.\nMorning tea , afternoon tea and lunch are provided.
