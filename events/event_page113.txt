                "text": "\n\nHave fun creating your very own masterpiece painting with acrylic on a 40x50cm canvas without ever having painted before!\nOur artists paint along with you demonstrating step-by-step from start-to-end how to paint the featured artwork while you enjoy the relaxing experience, sipping on a glass of your favourite beverage and socialising with friends.\nIts all about\u00a0Fun\u00a0Art, not\u00a0Fine\u00a0Art!\nAnd remember, we are a BYO studio,\u00a0so bring along your favourite bottle or two of liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint and sip with us on the day.\nYou supply the wine and we\u2019ll provide all the art materials, glassware and good vibes. Leave the rest to us!\nThis is not your typical painting class!\u00a0\n\nFAQs\n1. What time should I arrive to my session?\nFor our evening sessions, our studio doors open at 6.40pm and painting starts sharply at 7pm. For our Sunday afternoon sessions, our studio doors open at 1.40pm and painting starts sharply at 2pm. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your session's start time and check in with our artists, pour your wine, greet your fellow paint and sippers and get your paint colours.\n\n2. What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nOur Address:\u00a0Our South Melbourne studio is located at 206 Clarendon Street, South Melbourne, Victoria 3205, on the corner of Clarendon Street and York Street.\nPublic Parking:\u00a0Public parking is available on both streets but note, parking metre fees apply at some locations during the day. Also available are the Woolworth and Aldi public parking garages located on York Street, about 50m from our studio.\nPublic Transport:\u00a0If you\u2019re catching public transport, Tram Route 12 brings you by our studio doors. Tram Stop 127 (heading into the CBD) is located in front of our studio.\n\n3. What can I bring into the event?\nWe are a BYO Studio. So, bring along your favourite liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint! A glass of wine or two helps bring out your inner artist. Also, you are welcome to bring along snacks and nibbles.\n\n4. Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nYou must be 18+ to attend a night session.

                "text": "Monthly True, Personal Storytelling Nights\u00a0\r\nfor Women in Melbourne\r\nFirst Tuesday of the Month\r\nMarch to November, 2019\r\n7.30pm \u2013 10pm\r\nThe Venue will change some months, but always be in the inner north of Melbourne.\u00a0\r\nWomen\u2019s experiences are different, how we see the world, how we are treated in the world, how we make sense of the world are unique and diverse.\r\nWomen\u2019s stories are not heard as loudly,\u00a0as often,\u00a0as seriously or as humourously as they could be.\r\nWomen need space and time to tell, to be heard, to listen and connect through sharing our experiences,\u00a0through our crafted stories. \u00a0We need to make sense of our lives in a way that brings peace and hope to the events that have shaped us, as we then in turn shape them into a story. We then give this as part gift part message to our audience and know ourselves in a deeper way.\r\nThis is an open opportunity eight women to tell a 5 \u2013 10\u00a0minute true story \u2013 no notes, it happened to you, and for the rest of us to listen. There is no obligation to tell a story, in fact listeners are needed just as much as tellers. The nights are themed, so check below for the themes.\u00a0\r\nYou can buy a meal beforehand and drinks at the bar then settle in, and let the stories begin.\u00a0\u00a0See the\u00a0Story Wise Women\u00a0webpage for more information, including Frequently Asked Questions.\r\nEach storytelling event has a theme. Themes are meant as prompts, guides, helpful for those of us stuck, not to restrict or stump you. If you have a story knocking inside you that needs to be told and you think it has no connection to the theme, that is fine too. Here are the themes for 2019:\r\n5 March, 2019 Theme: Women\r\nTell us a story about one or one thousand women in your life, from the woman who birthed you to the woman packing your shopping. Wade into the mirky waters of gender roles and expectations, of the times you've been put in your place as a woman or relished in the joy of womankind. Tell us about being \u2018More Powerful Together' - the theme of this year\u2019s International Women's Day. Share with us when you were mentored and supported or when there was safety in numbers. Hold your hand to the story, always the story, not the rant or the rave, but the heart and emotions, the people and the place. Tell us a story for International Women's Day.\r\n2 April,\u00a02019 Theme: Seasons \r\nTells us a story from a season of your life, or one evoked by a season, a story from spring - blossoms and blooming, sex in the air, fertility bursting. Harvest a story from summer, the long hot lazy days, a stand out New Year or beach trip, the dry north wind, or a hot start to the school year. Feel into the heart of autumn, with its beauty and melancholy, the darkness pressing and the days getting shorter, or share a story from deep winter, coats and long underwear, indoors, heating, hot butter, tea and cocoa (and it can also be a seasonal metaphor). Or tell us about a time you encountered people living in a different season - the very old or the very young; teenagers, newly weds, adult children, C suites or Gen XYZ.\r\n7 May, 2019 Theme: Music\r\nListen for the story that sings to you, share with us the notes of birdsong, tell us about your first pop song, radio station, band crush or concert. Tell us about learning to play: the instrument, the practice, the tunes, and the exams. Remember the teachers, the choir, the school song and the anthems. Share a story about your diva fantasies, or your first heart break tune; belt out a ballad, break our hearts with Dion, (because we'll always love you). Tell us a tale about the orchestra, the opera, or your Mum's favourite record. Serenade us with strains, lullaby us with lyrics, let the music inside you, come out through a story.\r\n4 June,\u00a02019 Theme: Fate\r\nTell us a story about serendipity, the stars aligning, it all falling into place, being in the right pace at the right time. Then again, maybe tell us about when you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, when it all fell apart, when the stars collided in catastrophe. Share a story with the 20:20 vision of hindsight, when the signs were all there but you didn't see them, when it all makes sense only now. Tell us about the fateful day, the fated meeting, the chance encounter, the things that 'were meant to be'. Wait, isn't that all of it? Or is it? Let the story lead the way.\r\n2 July, 2019 Theme: Food\r\nTell us a story about the best meal, the worst, the time you burnt it all, including the curtains, that cafe meal when he told you it was over, the restaurant where you first held her hand. Share your grandmother's recipe, the family favourite or the birthday feasts. Tell us about the smells of home, the preparing and the processing the growing, washing and chopping. Tell us when you gagged, had a touch of gluttony or heaved it all overboard. What about the gastro, the dieting, the purging and the allergies, addictions and appetizers. Preserve it all in a tale for the depth of Winter.\r\n6 August,\u00a02019 Theme: Body \r\nTell us a story about the body, it's weakness and beauty, strength and impurity. Tell us about a time your body was amazing, you ran, leapt or danced, you clambered, climbed or carried, it soared or softened, strained or climaxed. Tell us about when it failed you, betrayed and deserted you, tell us about illness, accident or ageing. Tell us about wombs expanding and birthing, guts heaving and contracting, rejecting, eliminating and cramping. Tell us when you were on fire, strutting like everyone was watching, or about the constant moving feast of emotions. Whatever story calls, the body was always there.\r\n3 September,\u00a02019 Theme: Play \r\nTell us a story about play: playing a trick, a board or a sports game, a scripted story or plain old fashioned child's play. Play with the theme, the story, your listeners or yourself. Loosen up and have some fun, or get hardline about the rules. If you've ever played with kids, been a kid, cheated, or been cheated on, had white line fever, played the game or been played for a fool, been to the theatre or played with yourself, you've got a play story to share.\r\n1 October, 2019\u00a0 Theme: Power\r\nShare a story about the power, when the lights went out, and then sang back on, the batteries ran out or the fuse blew. Tell us about the power of adults - the teacher, parent, boss or police, how they used or maybe abused it, tell us about a time you felt powerless, or powerful, empowered and potent. Tell us when you felt the surge of your own power within, or when you too exercised power over. Share a story of the moving power feast, that shifts back and forth, drains and surges. Or maybe a story about the time you were totally awed by the greatest power of all, nature.\r\n5 November 2019 (Cup Day) Theme: Face\r\nTell us a story with a face at its heart, the face of innocence, lust, anger or glinting eyed greed. Tell us about a look in the eye, a face you couldn't see, a sleeping baby's peace. Tell us about what you faced that day, or when you turned to face your future, or maybe it was your past? Share a story of facing the facts, facing the truth, facing away. The smile that lights up the world, the tears you brushed away, the dearest face in the world to you. Tell us about your own face, its nooks and crannies, its peaks and valleys, the scars, the makeup, the dental treatment and the lines. Face your story, then shape it to share.\r\nSee the Story Wise Women webpage for more information, including Frequently Asked Question.\u00a0",

Imperfections....a glitch that changed your course either for the better or for the worse. Times that even Beyonce couldn't say \"I woke up like this.\" Some say the flaws are what makes something beautiful. \n-------\nHow to Tell at The Moth StorySLAM\n\nConsult our calendar to find our published theme.\nConjure, channel, craft and compose your story.\nPractice so you can remember it without the benefits of paper. Then practice it so you can keep it down to five minutes. Tell it to your plants but know that they are a tough audience. Revise. Rework. Curse your plants for not believing in you! Revamp. Finesse. Shave off another two minutes. Try again. Voila! Forgive your plants. Indeed, they helped you see the light.\nCome to the Moth StorySLAM and put your name in the hat. If you are one of the lucky 10 picked, you\u2019ll have five minutes to woo the audience with tales of your on-theme escapades. Unpicked? Fear not, some variation of your theme will surely rise again. All stories have multiple themes and stretching them to fit can be fun and even bring out elements you hadn\u2019t recognized before.\nContestants are judged on sticking to the five-minute time frame, sticking to the theme and having a story that has a conflict and a resolution.\n\nBe forewarned:\nMoth stories are told, not read. We love how the storyteller connects with the audience when there is no PAGE between them! Please know your story \u201cby heart\u201d but not by rote memorization. No notes, paper or cheat sheets allowed on stage.\nHave some stakes.Stakes are essential in live storytelling.\u00a0\u00a0What do you stand to gain or lose? Why is what happens in the story important to you?\u00a0If you can\u2019t answer this, then think of a different story. A story without stakes is an essay and is best experienced on the page, not the stage.\nStart in the action.Have a great first line that sets up the stakes or grabs attention.\nNo: \u201cSo I was thinking about climbing this mountain.\u00a0\u00a0But then I watched a little TV and made a snack and took a nap and my mom called and vented about her psoriasis then I did a little laundry (a whites load) (I lost another sock, darn it!) and then I thought about it again and decided I\u2019d climb the mountain the next morning.\u201d\nYes: \u201cThe mountain loomed before me. I had my\u00a0hunting knife, some trail mix and snow boots. I had to make it to the\u00a0little cabin and start a fire before sundown or freeze to death for sure.\u201d\nSteer clear of meandering endingsThey kill a story! Your last line should be clear in your head before you start. Yes, bring the audience along with you as you contemplate what transpires in your story, but remember, you are driving the story, and must know the final destination. Keep your hands on the wheel!\nKnow your story well enough so you can have fun!Watching you panic\u00a0to think of the next memorized line is harrowing for the audience. Make an outline, memorize your bullet points and play with the details. Enjoy yourself. Imagine you are at a dinner party, not a deposition.\nNo standup routines please.The Moth LOVES funny people but requires that all funny people tell funny STORIES.\nNo rants:Take up this anger issue with your therapist, or skip therapy and shape your anger into a story with some sort of resolution. (Stories = therapy!)\nNo essays:Your eloquent musings are beautiful and look pretty on the page but unless you can make them gripping and set up stakes, they won\u2019t work on stage.\n\n\u00a0How to Be a StorySLAM Judge\n\nLet it be known! Seek out Moth team and ply with flattery and gifts, or just hang by the hat and ask!\nOnce picked, be wise and heed the rules. Judge on the simple criteria: on time, on topic, a story (not stand-up comedy, an essay, or a rant) and true.\n\n\n\nPlease also note:\u00a0\n- Seating is not guaranteed and is available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n- Please be sure to arrive at least 10 minutes before the show. Admission is not guaranteed for late arrivals.\n- All sales final.\n- Total ticket price online includes an Eventbrite booking fee & GST.\nFor up to date local Moth info, join our Moth in Melbourne Facebook group!",

A story without stakes is an essay and is best experienced on the page, not the stage.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Start in the action.</STRONG><BR>Have a great first line that sets up the stakes or grabs attention.</P>\n<P>No: \u201cSo I was thinking about climbing this mountain.\u00a0\u00a0But then I watched a little TV and made a snack and took a nap and my mom called and vented about her psoriasis then I did a little laundry (a whites load) (I lost another sock, darn it!) and then I thought about it again and decided I\u2019d climb the mountain the next morning.\u201d</P>\n<P>Yes: \u201cThe mountain loomed before me. I had my\u00a0hunting knife, some trail mix and snow boots. I had to make it to the\u00a0little cabin and start a fire before sundown or freeze to death for sure.\u201d</P>\n<P><STRONG>Steer clear of meandering endings</STRONG><BR>They kill a story! Your last line should be clear in your head before you start. Yes, bring the audience along with you as you contemplate what transpires in your story, but remember, you are driving the story, and must know the final destination. Keep your hands on the wheel!</P>\n<P><STRONG>Know your story well enough so you can have fun!</STRONG><BR>Watching you panic\u00a0to think of the next memorized line is harrowing for the audience. Make an outline, memorize your bullet points and play with the details. Enjoy yourself. Imagine you are at a dinner party, not a deposition.</P>\n<P><STRONG>No standup routines please.</STRONG><BR>The Moth LOVES funny people but requires that all funny people tell funny STORIES.</P>\n<P><STRONG>No rants:</STRONG><BR>Take up this anger issue with your therapist, or skip therapy and shape your anger into a story with some sort of resolution. (Stories = therapy!)</P>\n<P><STRONG>No essays:</STRONG><BR>Your eloquent musings are beautiful and look pretty on the page but unless you can make them gripping and set up stakes, they won\u2019t work on stage.</P>\n<HR>\n<P>\u00a0<STRONG>How to Be a StorySLAM Judge</STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Let it be known!

                "text": "Learn more about Integrated Cost and Schedule Risk Analysis\nAre you a project controls or risk professional, or would you like to increase the maturity of risk awareness in your own organisation?\nSafran, in cooperation with partner Australasian Project Planning, invites you to our presentation exploring this topic and looking at Safran Risk 7.3 the latest tool that helps in achieving this.\nSantosh Bhat, Planning and Schedule Risk Professional will be running two interactive presentations on integrated cost and schedule risk analysis in Melbourne, Victoria on the morning and afternoon of Wednesday the 22nd of May. Topics included will be:\n\n\nWhat is integrated cost and schedule risk analysis and why is it important\n\n\nWhat sets Safran Risk apart from legacy risk applications\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of an integrated approach\n\n\nHow can your organisation get started\n\n\nIntegrating cost and schedule risk in a single environment opens the door to endless analytical possibilities. The presentation will demonstrate a full range of use - from maintaining a simple list of risks in a spreadsheet to performing a detailed quantitative risk analysis, for both schedule risk and cost risk. The embedded scheduling engine power of Safran Project allows Safran Risk to seamlessly complete full scenario analysis across all cost, schedule and risk variables. \nDeveloped by the team who brought you Pertmaster along with leading industry practitioners, Safran Risk is a modern tool with best practice risk analysis processes. The interface eases product adoption and dramatically helps to simplify what would otherwise be a complex or manual process.\nNot quite sure what level of risk maturity you are currently at? Safran in cooperation with Dr. David Hulett also offers a risk maturity tool and a recent publication \u201cA Journeymap to Project Risk Analysis.\u201d \nRegister now as spaces are limited! Tea/coffee and light refreshments will be provided at the morning session, and join us for drink at the hotel bar after the afternoon session.\n\u00a0Following the event, participants will be provided with a 30-day fully functional trial of Safran Risk.\n\u00a0\nFAQs\nHow can I contact the organiser with questions?\nPlease contact either:\nSantosh Bhat: santosh@auaspp.com.au\nMaria Simonsen: maria.simonsen@safran.com\n\u00a0",
