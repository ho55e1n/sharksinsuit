Joining forces with the fine folk at @Eat The Beat, we\u2019re bringing US house music legend Joeski to the rig at New Guernica, with a fine array of Subsonic residents and local heros throwing down their finest 4/4 in full support.\nJOESKI (Maya, Crosstown Rebels, Defected, Desolat, Poker Flat)\nJoeski\u2019s trajectory can be traced back to 1991, when he burst onto the NYC house music scene as a founding member of The Chocolate Factory DJ collective. Shortly after, he stormed into the clubs with top quality releases which quickly became firm mainstays in the crates of purveyors of the US noughties house music movement on Electrik Soul, Siesta, Chez and Camouflage, emerging as one of the most sought-after DJs, remixers and producers in the scene. Not skipping a beat, In 2001 Joeski launched Maya Records, with releases like \u201cHustler\u2019s Revenge\u201d and his collaboration with DJ Chus on \u201cEl Amor\u201d; now entering its 16th year, his Maya label continues a steady output of quality material, and Joeski continues to churn out the tunes while maintaining a steady schedule of international stints. Fueled by his genuine love of the music, there\u2019s no doubt that Joeski will continue to evolve both behind the decks and in the studio, captivating new generations of clubgoers and maintaining his place as one of dance music\u2019s most enduring talents.\u00a0\n\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\nPARTY INFO\n\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699 \nLINEUP:\nJOESKI (Maya, Crosstown Rebels, Defected, Desolat, Poker Flat) \nDylan Griffin (Subsonic Music)\nEtwas (Eat The Beat)\nMarcotix (Subsonic)\nMatteo Freyrie (Eat The Beat)\nMSG (Subsonic Music)\n+ more to be announced! \n\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\nDETAILS:Saturday 25 May 2019\n10pm - 5am @ New Guernica\n322 Little Collins St, Melbourne VIC 3000\n\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\u2699\n\nIn the first weekend of summer (and just an easy 2.5 hours of combined air and bus travel from your cultural gem of a city - we match our festival shuttle services to jetstar and virgin arrival times at Newcastle airport), 5 soul-shaking, diverse and stimulating stages featuring the best sound systems in the world will be booming the finest ambient, reggae, acoustic, world, techno, house, bass, hip-hop and electro-punk music created and collated by 180 exceptional local and international talents for 72 polyphonic hours.
