                "text": "Beaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry.

Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0</P>\n<P>In act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Act two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Audition Dates</STRONG></P>\n<P>Saturday 25 May 10am - 2pm<BR>If you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.<BR>Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.</P>\n<P><EM>For audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au</EM></P>\n<P><STRONG>Characters</STRONG><BR><SPAN>Young Henrietta (Henri)</SPAN>\u00a0- 30 something</P>\n<P>Henri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.</P>\n<P>This role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.</P>\n<P><SPAN>Henrietta (Henri)</SPAN>\u00a0- 60 something</P>\n<P>Thirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0</P>\n<P>The second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Cassie</SPAN>\u00a0- 25 years old</P>\n<P>On the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.<BR></P>\n<P>This role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Young Harry -</SPAN>\u00a030 something</P>\n<P>The young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.</P>\n<P>As an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0</P>\n<P>This role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Harry -</SPAN>\u00a060 something</P>\n<P>Harry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Harry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Justin -</SPAN>\u00a0late thirties\u00a0</P>\n<P>Justin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician.

Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox\u00a03 to 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \nComplimentary handout material \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Beaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Beaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "The Sun Bookshop invites you to celebrate the launch of Things Nobody Knows But Me by the award-winning Amra Pajali\u0107.\u00a0\nWhen she is four years old Amra Pajali\u0107 realises that her mother is different. Fatima is loving but sometimes hears strange voices that tell her to do bizarre things. She is frequently sent to hospital and Amra and her brother are passed around to family friends and foster homes, and for a time live with their grandparents in Bosnia.\nAt sixteen Amra ends up in the school counsellor\u2019s office for wagging school. She finally learns the name for the malady that has dogged her mother and affected her own life: bipolar disorder. Amra becomes her mother\u2019s confidante and learns the extraordinary story of her life: when she was fifteen years old Fatima visited family friends only to find herself in an arranged marriage. At sixteen she was a migrant, a mother, and mental patient.\nSurprisingly funny,\u00a0Things Nobody Knows But Me\u00a0is a tender portrait of family and migration, beautifully told. It captures a wonderful sense of bicultural place and life as it weaves between St Albans in suburban Australia and Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka in Bosnia. Ultimately it is the heartrending story of a mother and daughter bond fractured and forged by illness and experience. Fatima emerges as a remarkable but wounded woman who learns that her daughter really loves her.\n\u2018Brave, compassionate, searingly honest and funny, this is a memoir in a voice like no other. Amra Pajali\u0107\u2019s love letter to her mother is a book that grabs at your heart and doesn\u2019t let go until the final \u00a0page.\u2019 - Alice Pung\nThings Nobdy Knows But Me will be launched by best-selling\u00a0writer, editor, journalist and lawyer\u00a0Alice Pung, author of\u00a0Unpolished Gem,\u00a0Her Father\u2019s Daughter\u00a0and Laurinda, and the editor of the anthologies\u00a0Growing Up Asian in Australia\u00a0and\u00a0My First Lesson.\nThe book will be launched at 3pm on Saturday the 25th of May at the Masonic Hall,\u00a09 Willis St Yarraville.
