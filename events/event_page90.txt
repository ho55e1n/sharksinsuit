This was perhaps best demonstrated by his now famous late match-turning goal on debut for the Hawthorn football club in the final round of the 2016 season, which helped secure a one-point victory to see the Hawks into the finals.\u00a0 During his AFL career, he formed a strong relationship with Diabetes Victoria after being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 20; he became an ambassador in 2014, a role he continues to be committed to.\u00a0 We welcome you to come along and hear a story of inspiration and a never give up attitude.",
