Consider the anti-vaccination phenomenon, outcomes of government policies in the Murray-Darling basin, and the inadequacy of government policy and action on energy and climate change, and so on...\nWe can all do better than this!\nWe must continually improve our advocacy for science for the public good. This is a critical time as the federal election gives us all an opportunity to hold candidates to account for science, health, energy and environment policies, and especially our response to climate change.\nThe picnic, 12:30 to 4 pm will be on the grounds of the Royal Society of Victoria (or on the ground floor of the building in case of wet weather - limited space!). This will be free, but you will need to bring your own everything. There will be a poster competition with prizes to be awarded at about 3:30 pm.

You will need your ABA membership number to book a class so please join before booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership\nExpecting a baby? Have you got questions about breastfeeding? Most babies breastfeed within an hour of being born, so it pays to learn what to do well before your baby is due. Come to a relaxed, information-packed Breastfeeding Education Class for expectant mothers and their partners!\nAlthough breastfeeding is natural, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Our classes aim\u00a0 to provide expectant parents with the knowledge and confidence to successfully breastfeed.\nClasses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after your baby's birth.\nThey are presented by trained Australian Breastfeeding Association counsellors or educators. You can gain up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days in a relaxed atmosphere. \nWhy attend?\nAustralian research has shown that many mothers wish they had received more preparation for breastfeeding and the early months of parenting prior to the birth of their baby. Attending an ABA Breastfeeding Education Class complements and expands on any knowledge gained at antenatal classes and gives you the opportunity to:\nLearn some of the skills you will need to care for your new baby \nFind out how breastfeeding works, how to do it and what help is available \nMake informed choices about breastfeeding \nRealistically prepare for the changes about to happen in your life \nDiscuss questions and concerns you may have about breastfeeding \nDevelop a support network before giving birth \nFind your own path amidst all the varying advice\nWhat is covered in a class?\nHow breastfeeding works\nEstablishing breastfeeding and the first feed\nImportance of skin-to-skin contact in the first hours and beyond\nPositioning and attachment (how to hold and attach your baby to the breast)\nUnderstanding your milk supply\nDiscussion of what is 'normal' for a breastfed baby\nRole of partners in breastfeeding\nAdjusting to parenthood - survival tips for the early days and weeks with a new baby\nCommon concerns and problem solving\nClasses also generally include:\nPrinted information to take home and keep\nA breastfeeding mother and baby demonstrating a breastfeed (when available)\n\u00a0\nFAQs\nAt what stage of my pregnancy should I attend a class?\nPlease consider a class during your second trimester \u2013 i.e. between weeks 13 and 24. This is to allow for your comfort and babies who arrive early. Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this! Please book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly.\nHow long does a class go for?\nClasses generally run for 4 hours, including a refreshment break.\nShould my partner come too?\nAbsolutely! They might not be doing the breastfeeding, but can be your major support and it really helps for them to learn everything with you. \u00a0Research has also found that your partner\u2019s help and support make a huge difference to the success of breastfeeding. If your partner is not able to attend or you are a sole parent-to-be, you are welcome to bring along another family member or support person.\nHow much does the class cost?\nOur classes are exclusive to Australian Breastfeeding Association members. The cost of the class is only $20 plus booking fee, plus annual membership ( $70 if you haven't yet joined or $55 if you are concession eligible).\nIf you are not yet a member, please join at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \u00a0before booking and note your membership number for your\u00a0 Breastfeeding Education Class registration.\u00a0\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks.

This object will last for all time, be finished to world class standards and represents great value being included in the enrollment fee.\r\n\r\nCan anyone enrol?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nYes, classes are informal in nature and flexible according to each individual's ability and working method but also small enough to afford significant one on one tutoring by our highly experienced course leaders. We welcome creatives wanting to refine or learn new skills as well as complete beginners, no experience is necessary, everyone is welcome.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat can I make? \u00a0\r\nWhatever your creative mind chooses to. There are no \"rules\" as to the subject or style of your composition, only a size limitation - it cannot exceed 250mm in any direction.\u00a0Included with your enrollment are a set of hand modeling tools allowing you to work on your pieces outside of class should you wish. You need only bring an open\u00a0mind and an enthusiasm for creative exploration!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhere are you located? \u00a0\r\nYou'll find us at 8 Spring St, Fitzroy, just off Johnston Street and behind the Goodlife Gym. Both the 96 and 112 trams are only a couple of minutes walk away. If coming by train the 96 tram will connect you from Parliament Station. Some free street parking is available but time limits may apply. Paid off street parking is available a short walk away.\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to bring? \u00a0\r\nAll materials and modelling tools are supplied but you are most welcome to bring your own tools or other aids should you wish. Have photos, items, drawings or other inspirational tools? Bring them along! If not don't worry, we have everything you need. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to wear?\r\nAprons are available for student use but it's best to assume you will get a little dirty in what is a functioning art foundry environment. Comfy closed toe shoes are a good idea for the same reason!\u00a0The classroom is climate controlled.\r\nAccessibility? \u00a0\r\nOur classroom is on the first floor via a set of stairs. We regret that wheelchair access is not available at this time. For safety reasons, some areas of Meridian Sculpture will be off-limits during the workshops but a short tour of the foundry and the various processes will be offered at t he start of your course.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat's your cancellation policy? \u00a0\r\nPlaces are non refundable and any cancellations later than 48 hours prior to the course commencement will incur the full fee. With notice prior to 48 hours we are happy to modify the booking to allow attendance in an alternate class on another date or transfer to another name. We require a minimum number of participants for workshops to go ahead, should we be required to change dates or postpone our workshop you will be offered another date or a full refund.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nI'm still not sure it's right for me, can I speak to someone in more detail?\u00a0 \r\nOf course you can!
