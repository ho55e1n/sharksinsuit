Connecting a Happy Mind with a Happy Body whilst fuelling it with Happy Food is our philosophy, giving the mind and body the best environment to transform and repair.\nPromoting a state of growth and repair is the opposite to being in a fight, flight or freeze response that leads to more inflammation and stress. Feeling happier and healthier you are more suggestible to change; you can bend like bamboo with flexibility seeing obstacles as opportunities. Why we do what we do encompasses transformation and the ability to truly change what is possible for you and your life.\n\nLearn and discover :\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAmanda\u2019s story of recovery from a paralysis at age 29\nThe science behind changing your mind and adapting to change\nMeditation and the importance of mindfulness\nThe power of the mind-body connection and how to master it\nHow to nourish your body on a cellular level\nLearn to view obstacles as opportunities with a fresh mindset\nGive your mind and body the right environment to repair and perform\n\n\u00a0\nWHY YOU WILL LOVE THIS WORKSHOP\nIt has been my passion to understand the mind-body connection. This has helped me to get the results I have wanted in my body. My passion has led to a career helping others to repair and transform their lives. In my experience, I found that there was a way to give my mind and body the best environment to repair. Addressing mindset, movement and nutrition I wanted to tackle my disease of Multiple Sclerosis from multiple angles, with a goal to shift the messaging of degeneration and inflammation in my body, to growth and repair pathways instead.\u00a0I want to share my findings and all the lessons I have learned over the past decade with you in these workshops.\n\n\nBIO\nAmanda has a passion to inspire and educate individuals to change their mind about what is possible in their mind, body and life. Believing that flexibility builds resilience, on her own personal journey of recovery, she has learned about the power of the mind-body connection. Achieving an integrated approach, she believes when given the right environment the mind and body can be capable of producing incredible results.\nAt her practice and wellness workshops, Amanda explores how to connect a happy mind with a happy body whilst fuelling it with happy food. At her workshops, Amanda shares her own personal experience of her diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis at age 24, that led to a paralysis on the entire left-hand side of her body at age 29 years old.

Connecting a Happy Mind with a Happy Body whilst fuelling it with Happy Food is our philosophy, giving the mind and body the best environment to transform and repair.</STRONG></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Promoting a state of growth and repair is the opposite to being in a fight, flight or freeze response that leads to more inflammation and stress. Feeling happier and healthier you are more suggestible to change; you can bend like bamboo with flexibility seeing obstacles as opportunities.

This has helped me to get the results I have wanted in my body. My passion has led to a career helping others to repair and transform their lives. In my experience, I found that there was a way to give my mind and body the best environment to repair. Addressing mindset, movement and nutrition I wanted to tackle my disease of Multiple Sclerosis from multiple angles, with a goal to shift the messaging of degeneration and inflammation in my body, to growth and repair pathways instead.\u00a0<SPAN>I want to share my findings and all the lessons I have learned over the past decade with you in these workshops.</SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>BIO</STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Amanda has a passion to inspire and educate individuals to change their mind about what is possible in their mind, body and life. Believing that flexibility builds resilience, on her own personal journey of recovery, she has learned about the power of the mind-body connection. Achieving an integrated approach, she believes when given the right environment the mind and body can be capable of producing incredible results.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>At her practice and wellness workshops, Amanda explores how to connect a happy mind with a happy body whilst fuelling it with happy food. At her workshops, Amanda shares her own personal experience of her diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis at age 24, that led to a paralysis on the entire left-hand side of her body at age 29 years old. With the odds stacked against her, she had to change her mind about what was possible, when she had no choice but to succeed.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>A decade later, now a Speaker and an accredited Sports Kinesiologist, she has made a full recovery.

Students develop capability when they apply knowledge and skills confidently, effectively and appropriately in complex and changing circumstances, in their learning at school and in their lives outside school.The Australian Curriculum is designed to help all young Australians to become successful learners, confident and creative individuals, and active and informed citizens. Presented as a developmental sequence of learning from Foundation - Year 10, the Australian Curriculum describes to teachers, parents, students and others in the wider community what is to be taught and the quality of learning expected of young people as they progress through school, and into their tertiary pathways and future careers beyond.The three-dimensional design of the Foundation \u2013 Year 10 Australian Curriculum recognises the importance of disciplinary knowledge, skills and understanding alongside general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities, and the Summit is aligned to key learning areas across these three dimensions to ensure all attendees:1. Develop transferrable Enterprise Skillsets and Capabilities to gain employability value\n2. Work with traditional, contemporary and emerging technologies that shape the world in which we live, and will increasingly define the future World of Work3. Develop understandings and capabilties in creating solutions through complex problem solving4. Explore sustainable patterns of living for themselves and others5. Engage with and respond to the designed world, and understand how to goal set and design for impact6. Educate, explore and equip themselves with understandings of the STEM workforce, career pathways and critical skills needed to enage in this sectorIn particular, the Summit will align to the Australian Curriculum: Technologies (as adopted by each state) which draws together the distinct but related subjects of Design and Technologies and Digital Technologies.\u00a0In the Australian Curriculum, capability encompasses knowledge, skills, behaviours and dispositions. Students develop capability when they apply knowledge and skills confidently, effectively and appropriately in complex and changing circumstances, in their learning at school and in their lives outside school.",

Taking place in Melbourne's North, this party will feature state-of-the-art stage and lighting designed by John Fish, Funktion-One sound by Full Throttle Entertainment, plus a creative direction rarely experienced within the realm of dance affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExact location to be revealed two weeks prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Klock\n\n\nThunderous. Cavernous. Immense. Rolling. Those are just some of the adjectives you can use to describe the disturbance in airwaves that Ben Klock musters. He wields his tracks like a sharply trained ninja, throwing them down in a way that activates dance floors to their full potential. There is a reason he is resident at Berghain: he is directly connected to the source. Stop it, don\u2019t even argue. No one does it better than Ben Klock.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen - http://bit.ly/benklocksc\n\n\n\n\n\nMind Against\n\n\nCerebral. Intense. Perspicacious. Deep. It\u2019s very apt that this Italian brother duo features the word \u2018Mind\u2019 in their production moniker: their music is deep explorations of the grey matter variety, and much of what they do mull over the philosophy of life. They are a large cog in DJ Tennis\u2019 Life & Death stable, they feature heavily on Tale of Us\u2019 Afterlife parties, and they title their productions after cosmic and mythological concepts like \u2018Elysium\u2019, \u2018Pulsar\u2019, and \u2018Solaris\u2019. Mind Against will envelop you with the thickest, warmest blanket of bass you have ever experienced.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen - http://bit.ly/mindagainstsc\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Cardini\n\n\nWarm. Epic. Post-punk. Garage Techno. If you don\u2019t like the direction where music is heading, stay the course and carve your own niche into musical consciousness. This is precisely what Jennifer Cardini did. She has been around for a hot minute, doing her thing in an unassuming way, sticking to her own vibe and never settling for less. She goes on to create Correspondent Records, inadvertently creating a whole new subculture of music that is equal parts cool as it is functional and different. If you don\u2019t know Jennifer Cardini\u2019s music then for the love of God get your head out of the clouds and pay attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen - http://bit.ly/jennifercardinisc\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal support: \n\n\n\n\n\nFlex Appeal presented by Bay Radio and Forgery +\n\n\nAeyem\n\n\nBackyard Blitz\n\n\nEdgework\n\n\nHandle Soundsystem\n\n\nJake Hughes\n\n\nJames Phillips\n\n\nJennifer Loveless\n\n\nMarli\n\n\nSteezy-E\n\n\nStefan Mac\n\n\nSuzuki Drift\n\n\nTraj\n\n\nWalter Juan\n\n\n\n\n\nStrictly 18+\n\n\n\n\n\nFB: Novel (Tours & Events)\n\n\nIG: @wearenovel\n\n\nSC: www.soundcloud.com/novelevents\n\n\nW: www.novel.com.au\n",

Choose between either of these paintings, or perhaps be inspired by both - and make it your own!\n--\nClasse Petit's Social Painting sessions are a fun way to meet new people, rediscover your love for painting or simply explore what creativity means to you in a relaxing, supportive environment. Our paint and sip events run for approx. 3 hours to allow plenty of time to socialise and get to know others in the room.\u00a0\nIn each session, we use at least one modern masterpiece to inspire our own work. We're not after reproductions \u2013 instead we fully encourage everyone to tell their own story by creating your own version of the featured art. You'll be surprised at what you come up with; in fact you'll fall in love with it and be proud to call it your own.\nEach social painting session only hosts up to 16 people.
