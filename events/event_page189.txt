I am looking for some volunteers to assist me to plant native tubestock at Keith, South Australia, during July this year. All the plants are local to the area and have been specifically chosen to encourage pollinators onto adjacent\u00a0agriculture.\nThe plantings form part of a four year 'Securing Pollination' project managed by Agrifutures Australia and the Rural R&D for profit program. Once mature these plantings will be used to investigate the effect restoring native vegetation can have on pollination services in agricultural landscapes.\nThe Keith planting day will be held on Saturday 13th of July on a Lucerne property (map and detailed description of site access will be sent to you upon registration). We will be planting all day (9am - 5pm) however you are welcome to stay as long or as short as you like. Keith is apoproximately 3.5\u00a0 hours drive from Adelaide so camping and meals will be provided for those people travelling from Adelaide.\u00a0 \nOnce numbers are confirmed I will be happy to arrange car pooling for those who need transport from Adelaide.\nThe planting area is flat and has easy car access. Although some lifting, bending, and kneeling will be required to complete the planting tasks so a moderate level of fitness is recommended. \nGloves, good-humour, tools, meals and snacks will be provided.\nI look forward to seeing you on the day.\nFor more information contact Nick Gellie\nmobile: 0448159203\nemail: nick.gellie@adelaide.edu.au",

We're not after reproductions \u2013 instead we fully encourage everyone to tell their own story by creating your own version of the featured art. You'll be surprised at what you come up with; in fact you'll fall in love with it and be proud to call it your own.\nEach social painting session only hosts up to 16 people.

The experience will allow you to leave behind your everyday routine so you get a proper chance to reset, recharge and reconnect.

One who is willing to become intertwined with the locals and who will immerse themselves in the experiences.\nOur ideal traveller will understand that our tours are different.\nThe tours are based on small group numbers to create a more personalised experience. We really want the opportunity to get to know you and for you to get to know us and others. We are not bound by rigid time schedules so we're never in a rush. We promote slow travel.

                "text": "HEAVY Magazine, Bear Parts Music & Wild Thing Presents\nCIRCLES - MELBOURNE\nThe 'Winter' Tour - Australia & New Zealand 2019\nWith Special Guests:\u00a0City Of Souls (NZ) & Ebonivory\n\n\n\u00a0\nTo borrow a saying from a very popular TV show, \"WINTER IS COMING!\u201d. Melbourne bred progressive alternative rock juggernaut\u00a0Circles\u00a0are today announcing their \u2018Winter\u2019 Tour across Australian landscapes, and to the shores of New Zealand throughout July & August 2019, with a new music video for their single \u2018Winter\u2019 (off latest album\u00a0The Last One) forthcoming as well. In addition, they are taking fellow\u00a0Wild Thing\u00a0powerhouses\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0and\u00a0Ebonivory\u00a0along for the ride. With each band\u2019s recent performances at PROGFEST 2019 completely breathtaking, and with\u00a0Circles' live show one of the most powerful and mind blowing going around, this is a tour you definitely do not want to miss!\u00a0\nThe tour lands in New Zealand first, where Auckland\u2019s post-alternative rock kings\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0will headline shows in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, then returns to Australia for\u00a0Circles\u2019 headline shows in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Belgrave, and Ballarat.\n2018 was a watershed year for\u00a0Circles, releasing their masterpiece album\u00a0The Last One\u00a0through\u00a0Wild Thing Records\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand and\u00a0Season Of Mist\u00a0internationally.\u00a0Louder\u00a0said that The Last One was \"...very much in a similar fashion to countrymen Karnivool, Circles have crafted a modern progressive tapestry with plenty of wider appeal thanks to songwriting nous coupled with their apparent technicality.\" They then joined\u00a0TesseracT\u00a0on their\u00a0Australian Tour in September\u00a0as special guests. Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast. Upon their return to Australia, they dazzled audiences on tour with\u00a0Dead Letter Circus\u00a0in December, before mesmerising\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0in January 2019, with memorable performances as the festival\u2019s Australian headliner playing to full houses every night.\u00a0\nCity Of Souls, New Zealand\u2019s six-piece premier alternative-progressive outfit, have just signed internationally to Australian record label\u00a0Wild Thing Records, as well as UK/EU bookings to\u00a0Artery Global. They recently released their very first taste of new music - with their new single \u2018Wolf\u2019, and its stellar accompanying music video. Amed with lush soundscapes that are deep on emotion, but filled to the brim with hooks, City Of Souls are truly captivating. A true NZ supergroup with members of multi platinum selling NZ acts, and following sharing the stage with Bring Me to The Horizon, Stone Sour, Limp Bizkit and PROGFEST 2019, the time is now to discover this incredible act.\u00a0\nHailing from Ballarat in rural Victoria, Australia,\u00a0Ebonivory\u00a0creates an engaging mosaic of raw emotion, complex rhythmic devices, and prismatic melody. The world-class 5-piece ensemble employs a unique distillation of alternative rock, progressive metal, post-hardcore and modern punk, delivering a breathtaking performance that unifies musicians, melomaniacs, and casual listeners alike. Recently, they announced singing to\u00a0Wild Things Presents\u00a0for Management.\nABOUT CIRCLES\nThe Last One,\u00a0an album of tremendous power and lyrical inventiveness, delivers on the promise made on their\u00a0Basick Records\u00a0debut album\u00a0Infinitas\u00a0(2013). With guitarist Ben Rechter assuming the role of lead vocalist and fellow band members Ted Furuhashi (guitar/backing vocals), David Hunter (drums), and Drew Patton (bass guitar/screamed vocals) providing a maelstrom of musical brutality, Circles have written and recorded a simply phenomenal album. The band\u2019s uniquely designed off-kilter stadium-like riffs and dynamic grooves, exemplified in the track\u00a0Dream Sequence, beautifully contrast with breathtaking soaring vocals and catchy hooks apparent in highlight song\u00a0Tether,\u00a0with new front-man Ben Rechter\u2019s lush melodic singing styling instantly becoming a signature of Circles\u2019 ever expanding sound.\u00a0\nFormed in 2010 by Ted Furuhashi, David Hunter and Drew Patton, Circles have constantly been at the forefront of progressive heavy music, with their musical foundations becoming a strong component of the worldwide djent movement. Their previous releases, 2011\u2019s EP\u00a0The Compass\u00a0(Basick Records) and 2013\u2019s\u00a0Infinitas,\u00a0garnered unanimously positive reaction from fans and critics across the globe. Circles' past European jaunts have included supporting heavy music luminaries such as\u00a0The Dillinger Escape Plan,\u00a0Monuments, and\u00a0After The Burial. In Australia, they\u2019ve toured nationally as direct support to eminent rock and metal acts such as\u00a0Periphery,\u00a0Fear Factory,\u00a0Twelve Foot Ninja, and\u00a0Ne Obliviscaris, while also performing at the nation\u2019s premier progressive music festival\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0on three occasions.\n\n\n",

Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast.

They recently released their very first taste of new music - with their new single \u2018Wolf\u2019, and its stellar accompanying music video. Amed with lush soundscapes that are deep on emotion, but filled to the brim with hooks, City Of Souls are truly captivating. A true NZ supergroup with members of multi platinum selling NZ acts, and following sharing the stage with Bring Me to The Horizon, Stone Sour, Limp Bizkit and PROGFEST 2019, the time is now to discover this incredible act.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Hailing from Ballarat in rural Victoria, Australia,\u00a0<STRONG>Ebonivory</STRONG>\u00a0creates an engaging mosaic of raw emotion, complex rhythmic devices, and prismatic melody. The world-class 5-piece ensemble employs a unique distillation of alternative rock, progressive metal, post-hardcore and modern punk, delivering a breathtaking performance that unifies musicians, melomaniacs, and casual listeners alike. Recently, they announced singing to\u00a0Wild Things Presents\u00a0for Management.</P>\n<P><STRONG>ABOUT CIRCLES</STRONG></P>\n<P><I>The Last One,\u00a0</I>an album of tremendous power and lyrical inventiveness, delivers on the promise made on their\u00a0Basick Records\u00a0debut album\u00a0<I>Infinitas\u00a0</I>(2013). With guitarist Ben Rechter assuming the role of lead vocalist and fellow band members Ted Furuhashi (guitar/backing vocals), David Hunter (drums), and Drew Patton (bass guitar/screamed vocals) providing a maelstrom of musical brutality, Circles have written and recorded a simply phenomenal album. The band\u2019s uniquely designed off-kilter stadium-like riffs and dynamic grooves, exemplified in the track\u00a0<I>Dream Sequence</I>, beautifully contrast with breathtaking soaring vocals and catchy hooks apparent in highlight song\u00a0<I>Tether,\u00a0</I>with new front-man Ben Rechter\u2019s lush melodic singing styling instantly becoming a signature of Circles\u2019 ever expanding sound.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Formed in 2010 by Ted Furuhashi, David Hunter and Drew Patton, Circles have constantly been at the forefront of progressive heavy music, with their musical foundations becoming a strong component of the worldwide djent movement. Their previous releases, 2011\u2019s EP\u00a0<I>The Compass\u00a0</I>(Basick Records) and 2013\u2019s\u00a0<I>Infinitas,\u00a0</I>garnered unanimously positive reaction from fans and critics across the globe. Circles' past European jaunts have included supporting heavy music luminaries such as\u00a0The Dillinger Escape Plan,\u00a0Monuments, and\u00a0After The Burial. In Australia, they\u2019ve toured nationally as direct support to eminent rock and metal acts such as\u00a0Periphery,\u00a0Fear Factory,\u00a0Twelve Foot Ninja, and\u00a0Ne Obliviscaris, while also performing at the nation\u2019s premier progressive music festival\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0on three occasions.</P>\n<H6><BR></H6>\n<HR>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/76013763/circlestour2019webportrait.jpg\"></P>"

                "text": "Keywords for India Lecture Series\nEmpire\nwith Professor Sanjay Subrahmayam\u00a0\nAbout the talk:\nTo some 'empire' in the context of India/South Asia is necessarily a reference to the British Raj, especially after 1858. But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nProfessor Sanjay Subrahmayam,\u00a0Distinguished Professor & Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA.\u00a0\nSanjay Subrahmanyam, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford. Educated at the Delhi School of Economics, the first decade of his working career was spent (with brief interruptions in Philadelphia and Cambridge) teaching economic history and comparative economic development at the same institution, where he was eventually\u00a0named Professor of Economic History (1993-95). Thereafter, Subrahmanyam taught from 1995 to 2002 as Directeur d\u2019\u00e9tudes in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris),\u00a0where\u00a0his position was on the economic and social history of early modern India and the Indian Ocean world.\u00a0In 2002, Subrahmanyam was appointed as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Indian History and Culture at the University of Oxford, a position he held for two years.\nAfter joining UCLA, Subrahmanyam served from 2005 to 2011 as founding Director of UCLA's\u00a0Center for India and South Asia.\u00a0He teaches courses on medieval and early modern South Asian and Indian Ocean history, the history of European expansion, the comparative history of early modern empires, and various aspects of world history. He continues to advise graduate students on Indian history, the history of the Iberian empires, and more generally on forms of \"connected histories\".\u00a0Subrahmanyam was Joint Managing Editor of the\u00a0Indian Economic and Social History Review\u00a0for over a decade, besides serving on the boards of a number of other journals in the US, UK, France, Portugal, and elsewhere. He was also one of the founding editors of the \"South Asia Across the Disciplines (SAAD)\" monograph series.In 2013, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was elected to a Chair in Early Modern Global History at the\u00a0Coll\u00e8ge de France\u00a0in Paris, and delivered a full series of lectures there over the year 2013-14. Since 2014 he continues to lecture as a long-term visiting professor, and has a regular media presence in France:\u00a0TV interviews appear for example\u00a0on\u00a0MediaPart\u00a0(May 2014), and\u00a0on\u00a0France Info\u00a0(April 2015).\u00a0Sanjay Subrahmanyam's book\u00a0Europe's India: Words, People, Empires, 1500-1800,\u00a0appeared in 2017 from Harvard University Press, and in a French translation in 2018.
