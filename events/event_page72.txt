Light refreshments will be provided, please RSVP for catering purposes.\u00a0\nAbstract:\nThis paper argues that spyware products sold to general consumer audiences are a greater threat to those who own Android devices than those who own iPhones. This is a consequence of the Android operating-system being inherently more permissive of software functionality, allowing third-party developers greater latitude to build programs of less restrained capability. The \u2018openness\u2019 of the Android environment, and the comparative \u2018closed\u2019 nature of the iOS environment, are deliberate design-choices reflecting ideological attitudes of how much \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 ought to be granted to end-users over their smartphone. In the case of spyware, this \u2018openness\u2019 can create a significant series of risks, affording malicious actors the opportunity for spying on the smartphone activities of unsuspecting targets. Such risks, however, are disproportionately carried by certain social groups over others. In particular, victims of family violence are a cohort who are significantly threatened by the rise of spyware and those who are Android users unfortunately carry a more pronounced level of risk. This paper therefore offers a reflection on the connections between coding choices and personal security risks. It will call for greater social-scientific interrogation of ideologies that underpin software design and the exploration of their implications for wider social problems\nAbout the speakers:\nDr Diarmaid Harkin is a Senior Lecturer in Criminology at Deakin University. His current active research projects examine the use of private security companies by family violence services; the threat of the consumer spyware industry; and the challenges of cyber-crime for the police. He has also conducted numerous studies into community policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0\nAdam Molnar's work focuses on policing and national security as they relate to practices of surveillance, the use of technology, and associated issues of privacy and social control.
