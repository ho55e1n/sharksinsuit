Not for the faint-hearted, this tour will introduce you to at least three Victorian distilleries and will bring together talented distillers, award-winning whiskies, and the best of Melbourne\u2019s coffee, food & spirits in Melbourne\u2019s south side. You will learn about the whisky-making process, taste different styles of grain spirit and discover stories about the past, present and future of whisky in Victoria.   You will be picked up at Federation Square at 10:00am and returned to the city at 6:30pm. What better place to end the tour than the wonderful whisky bar that is Whisky and Alement.

This lecture explores the story of their origins in what is now modern Lebanon; their role as traders and craftsmen across the Mediterranean; and the rise of their dominance in the western Mediterranean and North Africa through their great city of Carthage until their eventual conquest and destruction by Rome.\n\nLecture 2 | 2.20 - 3.10pm\nPaintings in Stone: Coloured figurative mosaics of North Africa\nThe tradition of (the creation of) coloured figurative mosaics has left a fantastic assemblage of these \u2018paintings in stone\u2019; particularly in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco), where mosaic production reached its heights in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. This lecture will review\u00a0the range of mosaic images and themes along with the organisation of\u00a0the mosaic workshops. It will look at the origins of high-quality coloured mosaics in Ptolemaic Alexandria in the 2nd century BC and trace their development up to the high point of North African mosaic manufacture of the 4th century AD, as seen in the decorative scheme at the Roman villa of Casale at Piazza Armerina in Sicily.\n\nBOOKINGS ARE ESSENTIAL",

This lecture explores the story of their origins in what is now modern Lebanon; their role as traders and craftsmen across the Mediterranean; and the rise of their dominance in the western Mediterranean and North Africa through their great city of Carthage until their eventual conquest and destruction by Rome.</P>\n<HR>\n<H5><STRONG><SPAN>Lecture 2 | 2.20 - 3.10pm</SPAN></STRONG></H5>\n<H4><STRONG><SPAN>Paintings in Stone: Coloured figurative mosaics of North Africa</SPAN></STRONG></H4>\n<P>The tradition of (the creation of) coloured figurative mosaics has left a fantastic assemblage of these \u2018paintings in stone\u2019; particularly in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco), where mosaic production reached its heights in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. This lecture will review\u00a0the range of mosaic images and themes along with the organisation of\u00a0the mosaic workshops. It will look at the origins of high-quality coloured mosaics in Ptolemaic Alexandria in the 2nd century BC and trace their development up to the high point of North African mosaic manufacture of the 4th century AD, as seen in the decorative scheme at the Roman villa of Casale at Piazza Armerina in Sicily.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>BOOKINGS ARE ESSENTIAL</P>"
