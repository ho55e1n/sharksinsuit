Once the distillation is underway you will get the chance to taste all the gins she has produced in the first year and keep your strength up with some tasty snacks from our bar. As the distillation continues you will learn more about the art of distillingand also have a chance to taste the new gin spirit fresh from the stiil.\nAfter the workshop Brogan will hand bottle\u00a0the \"special gin\" made that day\u00a0and sign the label on a 700ml bottle for each participant, which we will post to you soon afterwards (RRP $93).\nAt the end of the session you leave Brogan's Way Distillery with three 200mL bottles, one of each of our premium gins (RRP $96.50) and a stylish Brogan's Way Tote Bag (RRP $15) to carry them home.\nFAQs\n\u00a0Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nYou must be at least 18 years of age to attend this event.\u00a0\n\u00a0What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nBrogan\u2019s Way is located at 61 North St Richmond, VIC 3121, and is less than a 10 minute walk from these tram stops:\n12 TRAM | STOP 24 | VICTORIA ST,\u00a0109 TRAM | STOP 25 | VICTORIA ST\n48 TRAM | STOP 22 | BRIDGE RD,\u00a075 TRAM | STOP 22 | BRIDGE RD\nOffsite street parking is also available.\n\u00a0What's the refund policy?\nDue to the planning and reseources required for these events, we can only offer a refund on tickets cancelled more than one week before your scheduled tour.

                "text": "Suitcase Rummage\u00a0is a mini scaled market with giant rewards; it promises to be everything that is a market without the hassle. Its about bringing a suitcase (or two!) filled to the brim with your goods and treats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can be a part of the\u00a0Rummage\u00a0experience by selling wares or come along to buy some real beauties! There will be brilliant vintage, artwork, bric-a-brac, clothing, books, jewellery, seconds, hand-made, shoes, records, music, badges, cards, handmade paper, ......you name it!\r\n\u00a0\r\nCome for a bargain, a swap, or an old fashioned haggle. Suitcase Rummage is not to be missed!\r\n\u00a0\r\nYou must purchase a stall ticket to sell your wares, so please click on the link above and fill in your details. We will contact you with further information once you've registered!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNext step is... to bring your treats and goodies on the day and start selling like your grandma.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEasy as pie.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen:\u00a0Sunday May 12, 11am - 4pm\r\nWhere:\u00a0Kendall Lane, NewActon, Canberra\r\nCost:\u00a0$25\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease note:\u00a0We are unable to issue refunds under any circumstances except when the event is cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Terms and Conditions**\r\n1. Sales are only to be made from your suitcase.\u00a0There are to be no gazebos, fold out tables, clothing racks etc. \u2013 everything must fit in your suitcase. If any stall holders are found setting up these (or something of the like), you will be asked to pack them down. As our name suggests \u2013 it\u2019s sales out of suitcases, so your goods must be packed in a suitcase accordingly! Please\u00a0do not\u00a0arrive with your items in canvas bags, boxes, plastic carriers etc. Not only do we want to keep the aesthetic of Suitcase Rummage, it is not designed to be a full scale, conventional market. It is literally a Suitcase Rummage\r\n2. Arrivals and Departures.\u00a0All Suitcase Holders must have their names ticked off by the advertised start time of the market. Check in will open at least 1 hour before the event (depending on which market you\u2019re attending). We understand that some of you travel quite a distance to get here, and sometimes there are extreme circumstances \u2013 but please message us on Facebook, Instagram or email to let us know you\u2019re running late. We need to start the Rummage on time, as this is the time we advertise. Also, no stall holders are to start packing up before the advertised closing time of the event. Again, if we have advertised the Rummage to finish at 4pm, it\u2019s not fair if punters turn up at 3:30 and half the market has been packed up. You\u2019re also missing out on potential sales!\r\n3. As Suitcase Rummage, we have a few ideals we want to stick to.\u00a0We are advocates for recycling wares (of all kinds), and supporters of local artists, designers and not for profit organisations. Therefore, if your wares are mass produced or for commercial gain, then Suitcase Rummage is not the place for you. We will ask you to pack up your suitcase if you have not been honest with us about your products\r\n4. Suitcase Rummage takes no responsibility\u00a0for the safe keeping of personal property of\u00a0stall holders or rummagers while at the event. The security of your takings, goods and\u00a0personal items is your own responsibility. We advise that you keep any important possessions on your person at all times\r\n5. Suitcase Rummage encourages safe work place\u00a0practices\u00a0when it comes to the handling\u00a0of heavy equipment, particularly your suitcases. Please remember your own safety\u00a0when carrying your equipment, and ask for assistance if needed. Suitcase Rummage is\u00a0not liable for injury caused by the incorrect carrying of equipment\r\n6. Suitcase Rummage is an outdoor market and event.\u00a0It is the responsibility of individuals to ensure they have appropriate sun protection including, hat, umbrella, sunscreen and water. Suitcase Rummage is not liable for any weather related issues, including but not limited to: cancellations, damage of product or injury.\r\n7. We have a NO Refund policy.\u00a0We currently do not offer refunds for stall fees and cannot transfer your stall fees to another month or event.\u00a0We will refund all stall fees if the event is cancelled by Suitcase Rummage and only in this instance. If you do not agree with this policy, then please think carefully before you purchase your ticket online.\r\n8. Please take all your possessions and rubbish with you when you leave.\u00a0Please dispose of any food waste and rubbish appropriately \u2013 recycle any bits that can be recycled!!\u00a0If you have other items you no longer want to keep (i.e clothing items, books etc) please donate these to a local charity or op shop at the end of the market.\r\n\r\n",

Its about bringing a suitcase (or two!) filled to the brim with your goods and treats.\r\n\u00a0\r\nYou can be a part of the Rummage experience by selling wares or come along to buy some real beauties! There will be brilliant vintage, artwork, bric-a-brac, clothing, books, jewellery, seconds, hand-made, shoes, records, music, badges, cards, handmade paper, ......you name it!\r\n\u00a0\r\nCome for a bargain, a swap, or an old fashioned haggle. Suitcase Rummage is not to be missed!\r\n\u00a0\r\nYou must purchase a stall ticket to sell your wares, so please click on the link above and fill in your details. We will contact you with further information once you've registered!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNext step is... to bring your treats and goodies on the day and start selling like your grandma.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEasy as pie.When:\u00a0Sunday May 12th, 11am - 4pm\r\nWhere:\u00a0Northcote Town Hall (Civic Square, outside)\r\nCost:\u00a0$25\u00a0+ bf \r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease note:\u00a0This is an outdoor event! \r\n*We are unable to issue refunds under any circumstances except when the event is cancelled.\r\n\u00a0\r\n*Terms & Conditions*\r\n1. Sales are only to be made from your suitcase.\u00a0There are to be no gazebo's, fold out tables, clothing racks etc. If any Suitcase Holders are found setting up these (or something of the like), you will be asked to pack them down. Not only do we want to keep the aesthetic of Suitcase Rummage, it is not designed to be a full scale, conventional market. It is literally a Suitcase Rummage!\r\n2. Arrivals and Departures. All Suitcase Holders must have their names ticked off by 11am. We understand that some of you travel quite a distance to get here, and sometimes there are extreme circumstances - but please just give us a call and let us know you're running late.We need to start the Rummage on time at 11am, as this is the time we advertise. Also, no Suitcase Holders are to start packing up before 4pm. Again, we have advertised the Rummage to finish at 4pm, so it's not a good reputation for the Rummage if punters turn up at 3:30 and half the market has been packed up. You're also missing out on potential sales!!\r\n3. As Suitcase Rummage, we have a few ideals we want to stick to.\u00a0We are advocates for recycling wares (of all kinds), and supporters of local artists, designers and non for profit organisations. Therefore, if you're wares are mass produced or for commercial gain, then Suitcase Rummage is not the place for you. We will ask you to pack up your suitcase if you have not been honest with us about your products.\u00a0Also - as our name suggests - its sales out of suitcases, so your goods must be packed in a suitcase accordingly! Please do not arrive with your items in canvas bags, boxes etc.\r\n4. Suitcase Rummage takes no responsibility\u00a0for the safe keeping of personal property of\u00a0stallholders or rummagers while at the event. The security of your takings, goods and\u00a0personal items is your own responsibility.\r\n5. Workplace Health and Safety Suitcase Rummage encourages safe workplace practices when it comes to the handling\u00a0of heavy equipment, particularly your suitcases. Please remember your own safety\u00a0when carrying your equipment, and ask for assistance if needed. Suitcase Rummage is\u00a0not liable for injury caused by the incorrect carrying of equipment.\r\n6. We have a NO Refund policy.\r\nWe currently do not offer refunds for stall fees and can not transfer your stall fees to another month or event.\u00a0We will refund all stall fees if the event is cancelled by Suitcase Rummage and only in this instance.
