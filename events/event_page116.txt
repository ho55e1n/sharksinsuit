We know it\u2019s an important life skill that will be used throughout every stage of life and that\u2019s why we believe in taking a proactive and pre-emptive approach to build these important skills at school, at home, at work and throughout our communities. One of Smiling Mind\u2019s key focus areas is supporting young people to develop the skills they need to thrive in the modern world. We believe that every child and young person should have the opportunity to develop these skills regardless of socio-economic status, location or life situation. Our school-based program has been designed to support wellbeing whilst at the same time developing skills to support school engagement and positive behaviour within the classroom. Additionally, our programs can also support educator wellbeing too.\nIn order to have the greatest impact, we work with schools to support teacher, student and school wellbeing.\n\u2192 We want young people to grow up with the skills they need to navigate our modern challenging world.\n\u2192 We want them the ready and able to learn when they get to school and throughout their education.\n\u2192 We teach children about their physical bodies and we believe it\u2019s equally important to teach young people how to look after their minds.\nOur education goal, is to have Mindfulness on the National Australian Curriculum and as part of this we are working to empower teachers to bring mindfulness into the classroom. We provide professional learning and practical resources to educators, so they can bring mindfulness into their classrooms.
