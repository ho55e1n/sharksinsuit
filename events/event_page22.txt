Working with the relationship between strength and extraction and using an EK 43 Mahlkonig grinder, VST refractometer, SCA extraction numbers, and your taste buds to identify and achieve good results.\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nThis workshop is designed as the 2nd level of learning for the capable Barista, one who has completed 'Barista Path 1' or has experience working in a cafe or an espresso serving environment.\nWORKSHOP OBJECTIVES\n\u00a0By the end of this workshop you will be able to:\n\n1. \u00a0Understand the relationship between strength and extraction and the impact and value of brew ratios.\n\n2. Use an EK 43 Mahlkonig grinder\n3. Extract espresso using various brew ratios to show how much of strength there is compared to extraction\u00a0 % in the espresso.\n\n4. Use the refractometer to analytically measure an espresso TDS % to determine the strength and extraction % and measuring against CCC extraction map.\n\n5. Clean and calibrate the EK Mahlkonig grinder.\nBarista Path 2 workshop has been developed by Lisa Feeley (certified Educator and Licensed Q Grader) who, with her team foster a learning environment where you can try, test and clarify using relevant equipment.\n\n\nOnly 4 spots per class to ensure maximum time and attention can be given to all attendees.\n\n\nREGISTRATION & PAYMENT\nWe have no minimum numbers for any of our workshops, once you have registered, be assured that the workshop will go ahead.\u00a0\nREFUND POLICY\u00a0\n- For a full refund of workshop payment, cancellation must be requested a full 20 days prior to workshop date.\n-\u00a0If the learner requests cancellation less than 20 days before workshop date, 80% is refundable or 100% ticket is transferable to another workshop.\n- If the learner requests cancellation less than 7-days before the workshop, the ticket is fully transferable however not refundable.",
