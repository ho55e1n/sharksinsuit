Students will have the chance to try a couple of different timbers and will look at handling and sharpening chisels, and choosing wood. Carved lettering ought to be designed specifically for its purpose and there will be the opportunity to consider letter design and the differences between drawn or written letters and carved forms.\nThere will be a (short) list of equipment to bring, but wood carving tools will be available to use during class.\u00a0 \n\nPrerequisites:\nYou must be an intermediate level in calligraphy or an intermediate level in wood or stone carving.\n\nBackground:\nRobbie Schneider studied sculpture at Camberwell and Byam Shaw Art Schools in London and later specialised in lettering, training with some of Britain\u2019s best carvers. Originally from London, he now lives in Perthshire and works from his studio in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands. Most of Robbie\u2019s work is made to commission for public and private projects, but he also exhibits widely. His background in sculpture influences every aspect of his work. It is clearly true for calligraphers as much as for letter cutters that well-chosen words and good letterforms are only a starting point; it\u2019s where the two coalesce and are realised in specific materials that things become interesting. Robbie works with stone, wood, metals, plastics and other materials. All have different expressive potential as well as distinct limitations. But the technique is only a means to an end. As letterers, working with words must surely be about meaning and our work, an interaction and response to the texts we work with. Robbie\u2019s work can be found throughout Britain, from Canterbury Cathedral in the south to Shetland in the far north. He teaches letter cutting in stone and wood in Britain and Europe, and leads an annual stone letter carving and drawing course in Scotland. Robbie is chairman of Letter Exchange and an elected member of The Royal Society of Sculptors. His website is www.robbieschneider.co.uk\n\nThe discounted price\u00a0is available to members of the Calligraphy Society of Victoria.\u00a0 You are very welcome to join our society (membership for individuals is $30 valid until Sept 2019, annual memberships after that are $60).\u00a0 For more information, go to our\u00a0website\nIf you have any questions or would like to contact the organiser, please email CSVworkshops18@gmail.com\n",

                "text": "Technologies of Bordering:\u00a0Creating, Contesting and Resisting Borders Conference\nThis international conference is organised by the Universities of Manchester and Melbourne and brings together academics, practitioners and activists to discuss borders and technologies of bordering. Everyone is welcome to attend the conference but please register in advance. A full programme will be sent out after registration.\u00a0\nBorders are pervasive spatial, political and social features in contemporary society. Materially and symbolically manifest, borders are shaped by history, politics and power. They take various forms, have multiple functions and are ceaselessly changing. Through a wide array of material, digital and virtual technologies borders divide, exclude, contain, categorise, control, govern and protect people. For example, the presence or absence of documents such as passports, permits and identity cards control the movement of people across borders as do security and surveillance technologies like gamma ray scanners that can reveal undocumented bodies hiding in trucks that are attempting to cross borders. Such technologies are a material manifestation of bureaucratic systems that are mobilised to assign identities to people and ascertain their associated rights as citizens or non-citizens. Bordering processes and practices also produce and maintain communities but at the same time distinguish between those who belong and those considered strangers. Borders and bordering technologies are not always rendered visible. Indeed, biometric identify cards, for example, create borders that are delocalised and dispersed, potentially everywhere. Bordering technologies are exclusionary and affective mechanisms that are perceived and conceived by people in different ways, for instance through the separation and othering of gendered, racialised, colonised and indigenous bodies. While some borders have become more permeable for finance, goods and information, the notion of a \u2018borderless world\u2019 contradicts how most people live within clearly defined borders. Yet, borders have frequently been actively contested and negotiated.

                "html": "<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Technologies of Bordering:\u00a0Creating, Contesting and Resisting Borders Conference</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>This international conference is organised by the Universities of Manchester and Melbourne and brings together academics, practitioners and activists to discuss borders and technologies of bordering. Everyone is welcome to attend the conference but please register in advance. A full programme will be sent out after registration.\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Borders are pervasive spatial, political and social features in contemporary society. Materially and symbolically manifest, borders are shaped by history, politics and power. They take various forms, have multiple functions and are ceaselessly changing. Through a wide array of material, digital and virtual technologies borders divide, exclude, contain, categorise, control, govern and protect people. For example, the presence or absence of documents such as passports, permits and identity cards control the movement of people across borders as do security and surveillance technologies like gamma ray scanners that can reveal undocumented bodies hiding in trucks that are attempting to cross borders. Such technologies are a material manifestation of bureaucratic systems that are mobilised to assign identities to people and ascertain their associated rights as citizens or non-citizens. Bordering processes and practices also produce and maintain communities but at the same time distinguish between those who belong and those considered strangers. Borders and bordering technologies are not always rendered visible. Indeed, biometric identify cards, for example, create borders that are delocalised and dispersed, potentially everywhere. Bordering technologies are exclusionary and affective mechanisms that are perceived and conceived by people in different ways, for instance through the separation and othering of gendered, racialised, colonised and indigenous bodies. While some borders have become more permeable for finance, goods and information, the notion of a \u2018borderless world\u2019 contradicts how most people live within clearly defined borders. Yet, borders have frequently been actively contested and negotiated. Indeed, bordering technologies have promoted and prompted various strategies of evasion, resistance and solidarity, from the forging of documents and the transgressing of borders, to the rejection of borders through acts of political refusal and sovereignty. Importantly, borders have also been used and incorporated into people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, providing opportunities, progressive spaces and new ways of being.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>In this inter-disciplinary, international conference, we explore these issues and focus on the experiences of diaspora, migrants, refugees, citizens and stateless populations across different spatial contexts and historical periods.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Co-convenors:</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Dr Elise Klein (University of Melbourne)</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Professor Uma Kothari (University of Manchester)</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Agenda:</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Wednesday 3 July 5.15pm \u2013 8.00pm\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Opening plenary and reception\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>The Ian Potter Museum</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Thursday 4 July 9.30am \u2013 5.45pm</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Sidney Myer Asia Centre, Room 325</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>University of Melbourne</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Friday 5 July 9.00am \u2013 5.15pm</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Sidney Myer Asia Centre, Room 325</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>University of Melbourne</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Keynotes:</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Peter Mares\u00a0(Lead moderator of The Cranlana Centre for Ethical Leadership and adjunct fellow at Centre for Urban Transitions, Swinburne University, Australia).</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Suvendrini Perera\u00a0(John Curtin Distinguished Professor and Research Professor of Cultural Studies, Curtin University, Australia).</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Awale Ahmed (Poet and storyteller, chaired by Professor Uma Kothari and Dr Elise Klein)</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Ghassan Hage\u00a0(Professor of Anthropology and Social Theory, University of Melbourne, Australia).</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Ian Howard\u00a0(Artist and professor, Faculty of Art &amp; Design, University of New South Wales, Australia).</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Alison Mountz\u00a0(Professor of Geography and Canada Research Chair in Global Migration and Director of the International Migration Research Centre,\u00a0The Balsillie School of International Affairs, Canada).</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>As well as exciting talks by many other activists, academics and practitioners.\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Contact:</STRONG><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Enquiries can be made to the conference convenors:\u00a0Elise Klein, University of Melbourne (<A HREF=\"mailto:elise.klein@unimelb.edu.au\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN>elise.klein@unimelb.edu.au</SPAN></A>) and\u00a0Uma Kothari, University of Manchester (<A HREF=\"mailto:uma.kothari@manchester.ac.uk\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN>uma.kothari@manchester.ac.uk</SPAN></A>)</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Image credit: VLADYart (<A HREF=\"http://www.vladyart.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.vladyart.com/</A>)</SPAN></P>"

We then send you each other\u2019s details within 24 hours.</P>\n<P>Halfway through the night, we break so you can stretch your legs, maybe do a few squats (this is a joke by the way. Or is it..) before we finish off the rest of the speed dates! We may throw a few\u00a0burpees in there for you too..

                "text": "Register now to join the first ARCOM Doctoral Workshop in Australia on Large Infrastructure Projects!!\nOverview: Infrastructure projects (e.g. rail, roads, bridges, dams, oil & gas platforms, underground metros, etc.) facilitate economic and social activity in an economy. These assets form the critical lifeblood of economic prosperity and development of nations. However, large infrastructure projects are notorious for the many performance challenges that beset their planning, procurement and delivery \u2013 for example, more than 50% of large infrastructure projects experience significant cost and schedule overruns. \nThis workshop will be structured to allow the discussion of current infrastructure delivery problems and solutions. This will create the opportunity to ask critical questions, test ideas and initial hypothesis or solutions, as well as provide a debating forum that will help sharpen our collective understanding of the complexities associated with planning, appraisal, design, finance and governance of large infrastructure projects. \nWorkshop Themes (not exhaustive):\n\n\nProject Risk Quantification and Analysis\n\n\nIntegrated Strategic Asset Management\n\n\nInfrastructure planning & Investment analysis\n\n\nBenefits assessment in megaprojects\n\n\nPPPs and infrastructure delivery\n\n\nSustainable and resilient infrastructure\n\n\nMegaproject failure and success\n\n\nValue Capture and Major Land Transport Infrastructure\n\n\nFront-End Project Governance\n\n\nMegaproject complexity, risk and uncertainty management\n\n\nFuture-Proofing Infrastructure. \n\n\n\n\nCurrent and emerging infrastructure issues in Australasia\n\n\nSubmission of papers: To present your work at the workshop, please submit a short paper (not exceeding 6000 words which will be peer-reviewed by 2 established academics in the subject matter. Accepted papers will be published as part of the ARCOM Doctoral Workshop proceedings. For more information on past ARCOM Doctoral Workshops \u2013 see http://www.arcom.ac.uk/workshops.php.\nTravel Bursary: Some in-country (within Australia) travel bursaries may be made available by ARCOM for PhD students who are unable to attend due to financial constraints. Priority will be given to those whose papers have been accepted for presentation at the workshop.\nOverseas Presenters: Depending on time difference, we may be able to accomodate some presentations from PhD candidates from outside of Australia via Skype or Zoom. \n\nImportant Dates:\nInitial Abstract Deadline has now passed but full papers will be accepted by deadline below even if you've not submitted an initial abstract\nSubmission of first draft of paper: 1st March 2019, 23:59hrs AESTRefereeing decision: 22nd March 2019Submission of final paper: 3rd May 2019, 23:59hrs AESTFinal Refereeing decision: 24th May 2019\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n1.

These assets form the critical lifeblood of economic prosperity and the development of nations. The Australian Government has placed sustained emphasis on economic growth and productivity by investing significantly in major capital infrastructure \u2013 $100 billion has been committed to funding infrastructure projects over the next 10 years in the 2019 budget. Most of these projects are in the transport sector.\n\nHowever, these capital-intensive projects are notorious for the many performance challenges that beset their planning, procurement and delivery \u2013 for example, more than 50% of large infrastructure projects experience significant cost and schedule overruns. \n\n\nThis workshop will be structured to allow the discussion of current transport infrastructure delivery problems and solutions from industry organisations and academic researchers. This will create the opportunity to ask critical questions as well as provide a debating forum that will help sharpen our collective understanding of the complexities associated with planning, appraisal, design, finance and governance of large transport infrastructure projects. \n\nThemes for workshop presentations and discussions\n\n\nInfrastructure Planning & Investment Analysis\n\n\nThe Future of Transport Infrastructure\n\n\nPolitics, Project Appraisal and Transport Policy\n\n\nProject Risk Quantification and Analysis\n\n\nMegaproject Failure and Success\n\n\nFront-End Project Governance\n\n\nTransport Innovation, Security and Safety\n\n\n\nFAQs\n1.
