                "text": "\nThe Mindfulness Works exclusive 4-week introductory course provides you with an opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness.\nWHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?\n\n4 x classes\u00a0\n45-page guidebook\n4 week free gift subscription to the Calm premium mindfulness app\nWeekly emails with extra articles and instructions\nDownloadable guided mindfulness meditations for you to keep\n\nABOUT MINDFULNESS WORKS\nMindfulness Works is one of Australia's largest mindfulness training organisation. Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\u00a0\nNO RELIGION. NO DOGMA. NO FUNNY POSITIONS:\u00a0 This course is practical and fun with no religious elements at all. We sit in chairs, the language used is clear and modern.\nEXPERIENCED AND WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHERS:Receive guidance from experienced mindfulness teachers who have received our Mindfulness Works teacher training and partake in ongoing professional development.\n\n\nCOURSE TOPICS:\nWeek 1: What is Mindfulness and What are the Benefits?\nWeek 2: Mindfulness and The Thinking Mind\nWeek 3: Mindfulness and Emotions\nWeek 4: Mindfulness and Self-Compassion\n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE SUITABLE FOR?\nThis course is suitable for absolute beginners who have no or very little mindfulness and meditation experience. This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOU COURSE FACILITATOR IS COCO NKRUMAH\n\nCoco has been involved with mindfulness and meditation for over 10 years. His training began with Chinese Taoist meditation and during his years of training, Coco accomplished three certifications in Chinese meditation and shaolin qi gong.

                "text": "Welcome to FP Day, 13 May 2019\nYOW! Workshop: Let's Lens\nwith Ed Kmett and Tony Morris\u00a0\nLet's Lens presents a series of exercises, in a similar format to the Data61 functional programming course material. The subject of the exercises is around the concept of lenses, initially proposed by Foster et al., to solve the view-update problem of relational databases.\nThe theories around lenses have been advanced significantly in recent years, resulting in a library, implemented in Haskell, called lens.\nThis workshop will take you through the basic definition of the lens data structure and its related structures such as traversals and prisms. Following this we implement some of the low-level lens library, then go on to discuss and solve a practical problem that uses all of these structures.\nAn attendee who completes this workshop should expect to confidently use the lens library, or other similar libraries, in their every day programming.\n\nWorkshop Requirements\n\nLaptop with wifi-internet access\u00a0\nAn internet connection\nhttps://gist.github.com/tonymorris/264af4e90afb755e0e8a2c20659c50a2\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n8:30 \u2013 9:00 am Registration and arrival tea/coffee\u00a0\n9:00am\u00a0 Workshop begins\n10:30 - 10:55 am Morning Tea (included)\n12:30 - 1:25 pm Lunch\u00a0(included)\n3:15 - 3:30 pm Afternoon Tea\u00a0(included)\n5:00 pm Workshop ends\n\u00a0Please note times may vary at the workshop facilitator's discretion.\n\n\u00a0\nAbout Ed Kmett\n\nEdward spent most of his adult life trying to build reusable code in imperative languages before realizing he was building castles in sand. He converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better building materials. He now chairs the Haskell core libraries committee, collaborates with hundreds of other developers on over 150 projects on github, builds tools for quants and traders using the purely-functional programming-language Ermine for S&P Capital IQ, and is obsessed with finding better tools so that seven years from now he won\u2019t be stuck solving the same problems with the same tools he was stuck using seven years ago.\n\nAbout Tony Morris\n\nTony Morris is a software product developer who has deployed functional programming techniques in industry for over 10 years. Tony teaches at the tertiary level and for professional programmers with a view toward producing a viable commercial result. Tony is currently a Senior Software Engineer at NICTA where he is tasked with promoting and educating on functional programming for the benefit of all Australian software developers.\nTony takes a fastidious, principled approach to functional programming both when deployed in practice and when in a learning environment to ensure maximum yield from the effort. Tony believes that exploring principles and the following consequences provides a rewarding experience for all involved.\n\n\u00a0\nGroup tickets and Sponsorship\u00a0\nPlease email\u00a0info@yowconference.com\u00a0if you'd like to purchase group tickets.\u00a0Contact the\u00a0partnership team\u00a0to request a copy of our sponsorship partnership package or for more details on how we can tailor a specific package for your needs.\n\u00a0\nTransfer, Cancellation and Refunds\u00a0\nIn the event that you have booked for the conference or workshops and are unable to attend, you may send another person to attend in your place provided you inform YOW! organisers of the change not less than 72 hours prior to the conference or workshops.\u00a0Please see our full\u00a0terms and conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, visit\u00a0yowconference.com.au\u00a0or contact\u00a0info@yowconference.com",

                "text": "Welcome to FP Day, 13 May 2019\nYOW! Introductory Workshop (Beginner - Intermediate): Intro to Elixir\nwith Josh Price and James Sadler\nElixir is an extremely accessible functional programming language that is rapidly gaining popularity for good reason. With it's well curated, batteries-included tool chain, excellent documentation and it's sheer simplicity, not to mention its incredible 30+ year Erlang heritage.\nThe goal of this workshop is to get you a basic familiarity with Elixir and the tools you'll need to be effective working in the language. It will be aimed at programmers who don't know Elixir, and don't necessarily know any functional programming.\nThe workshop is organised around a set of exercises that should take you through the basics of the language. Once you've got to grips with the language and tools you'll be ready to build a real time game server. In this workshop you'll learn everything you need to start building amazing, production ready Elixir applications.\n\n\nWorkshop Requirements\n\nLaptop with wifi-internet access\u00a0\nAn internet connection\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n8:30 \u2013 9:00 am Registration and arrival tea/coffee\u00a0\n9:00am\u00a0 Workshop begins\n10:30 - 10:55 am Morning Tea (included)\n12:30 - 1:25 pm Lunch\u00a0(included)\n3:15 - 3:30 pm Afternoon Tea\u00a0(included)\n5:00 pm Workshop ends\n\u00a0Please note times may vary at the workshop facilitator's discretion.\n\n\u00a0\nAbout Josh Price\n\nJosh Price is a polyglot software developer and technology consultant based in Sydney, Australia. He's passionate about modern approaches to Software Development and helping teams build amazing software faster with better tooling. He usually describes himself as an applied problem solver, occasionally by writing software.He organises community events such as the Elixir Sydney and GraphQL Sydney meetups. He also co-founded Alembic, which is building a team to bring functional programming and strongly typed APIs and their benefits to everyone's day to day work.Currently most of his work involves working with GraphQL and Elixir at the intersection of the realtime web.\n\nAbout James Sadler\u00a0\n\nJames is a polyglot software developer with a love for functional programming and technical communities. He has run Rails and Elixir Camps, volunteered for Elixir Girls, and co-hosts the GraphQL Sydney and Elixir Sydney meetups.\nOriginally from the UK, James arrived in Australia in 2005 and his early Australian career was characterised by traditional enterprise software development. A short time later he was introduced to the wonderful Australian Ruby community, but eventually functional programming and Erlang & Elixir were too alluring to ignore.\nCapitalising on this, in February 2017 James co-founded Alembic to write well-engineered and robust apps using Elixir/GraphQL/React bringing performance and reliability to the next level.\n\n\n\u00a0\nGroup tickets and Sponsorship\u00a0\nPlease email\u00a0info@yowconference.com\u00a0if you'd like to purchase group tickets.\u00a0Contact the\u00a0partnership team\u00a0to request a copy of our sponsorship partnership package or for more details on how we can tailor a specific package for your needs.\n\u00a0\nTransfer, Cancellation and Refunds\u00a0\nIn the event that you have booked for the conference or workshops and are unable to attend, you may send another person to attend in your place provided you inform YOW! organisers of the change not less than 72 hours prior to the conference or workshops.\u00a0Please see our full\u00a0terms and conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, visit\u00a0yowconference.com.au\u00a0or contact\u00a0info@yowconference.com",

                "text": "Welcome to FP Day, 13 May 2019\nYOW! Introductory Workshop: Intro to Functional Programming (FP)\nwith\u00a0Manuel Chakravarty\nFunctional programming has become inevitable. New programming languages draw inspiration from the functional paradigm; old programming languages retrofit support for functional programming; and development teams change their coding style to adopt the best functional programming idioms. We are clearly experiencing a paradigm shift in our industry.\nDue to its academic roots, functional programming sometimes seems unapproachable, with unfamiliar jargon, obscure concepts, and bewildering theories. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that.\nIn this one-day series of lectures and hands-on workshops, we will translate the jargon, demystify the concepts, and put the theories into practice. There is nothing inherently difficult about functional programming. In fact, its main aim is to simplify programming and to make it more widely accessible. Functional programming is about being able to understand one function without the million lines of code it is a part of. It is about code reuse. It is about modularity and keeping code easy to change and refactor. These are all goals of good program design that every developer appreciates. Based on this common ground, we will explore functional programming together and see how it can help us to achieve these design goals. In fact, by learning the fundamentals of functional programming in Haskell, we can improve program design in mainstream languages, such as Javascript and C++, and even more so, in hybrid languages, such as Scala and Swift.\nThroughout the day, we will explain the most commonly used functional programming terminology. You will learn the fundamentals of Haskell, one of the most popular functional programming languages. In the process, we will look at a lot of concrete code to understand what functional programming is all about and how to use it in your own programs. In the workshops, you will have plenty of opportunity to write code yourself, experiment, and ask questions. It\u2019ll be fun!\n\n\nWorkshop Requirements\n\nLaptop with wifi-internet access\u00a0\nAn internet connection\nYour curiosity\u00a0\n\nBy the end of the day, functional programming will be another tool in your toolbox, and you will be ready to enjoy the main YOW! Lambda Jam conference.\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n8:30 \u2013 9:00 am Registration and arrival tea/coffee\u00a0\n9:00am\u00a0 Workshop begins\n10:30 - 10:55 am Morning Tea (included)\n12:30 - 1:25 pm Lunch\u00a0(included)\n3:15 - 3:30 pm Afternoon Tea\u00a0(included)\n5:00 pm Workshop ends\n\u00a0Please note times may vary at the workshop facilitator's discretion.\n\n\u00a0\nAbout\u00a0Manuel Chakravarty\n\nManuel M T Chakravarty works with Tweag I/O as a functional programming evangelist, architects blockchain languages at IOHK, and develops the interactive development environment Haskell for Mac \u2014 one of the first Swift apps on the Mac App Store. His interests span from functional programming, novel compiler technology & programming language theory over high-performance & distributed computing to blockchain technology.\u00a0He used to be an associate professor at UNSW Sydney and contributed to both the design and implementation of the Haskell programming language as well as several Haskell tools and open source libraries, including multiple systems for data parallel programming of multicore CPUs and GPUs. Over the last few years, he focused on making functional programming more broadly accessible and on exploring its role in app development in Swift. Currently, he is busy researching and developing a novel approach to blockchain contract development with IOHK's Plutus Team. Most importantly, he believes in the fruitful combination of theory and practice.\n\n\n\u00a0\nGroup tickets and Sponsorship\u00a0\nPlease email\u00a0info@yowconference.com\u00a0if you'd like to purchase group tickets.\u00a0Contact the\u00a0partnership team\u00a0to request a copy of our sponsorship partnership package or for more details on how we can tailor a specific package for your needs.\n\u00a0\nTransfer, Cancellation and Refunds\u00a0\nIn the event that you have booked for the conference or workshops and are unable to attend, you may send another person to attend in your place provided you inform YOW! organisers of the change not less than 72 hours prior to the conference or workshops.\u00a0Please see our full\u00a0terms and conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, visit\u00a0yowconference.com.au\u00a0or contact\u00a0info@yowconference.com",

These networks have performed a valuable role in connecting and coordinating strategic and operational activities.\nAn opportunity exists to re-design these networks, so they can serve our communities more effectively.\nThree of these Networks operate in a reasonably similar way, and are directly funded by Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Central Highlands Area. These networks are:\n\nThe Central Highlands Integrated Family Violence Committee (CHIFVC)\nThe Central Highlands Family Services Alliance (CHFSA)\nThe Central Highlands Housing and Homelessness Alliance (CHHA)\n\nThere has been discussion and deliberation about how the operation of these Networks could be reformed for some time. These discussions have been happening at various levels across the sector. Some people are very familiar with the ideas that have been raised. Others may be hearing about them for the first time today.\nThis workshop will bring together members from each of these networks to discuss proposed options for the future. All members \u2013 Executive and Operational \u2013 are invited to be part of these discussions.\nThere are many more collaborative networks in the Central Highlands social service sector than those listed here. For instance, the \u2018Orange Door\u2019 Support and Safety Hub is forming in 2019 following recommendations of the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence; the Grampians Dhelk Dja Family Violence Action Group Partnership Forum addresses family violence in Aboriginal communities across the broader Grampians region; the Central Highlands Out of Home Care Alliance and Operations, the soon-to-be-defunded Central Highlands Child and Youth Area Partnership that focuses on connections between social services and education for young people; the Regional Development Victoria Regional Forums. There are too many to list in full! These groups will not be considered as part of this redesign at this point because they operate considerably differently to CHIFVC, CHFSA and CHHA, and are resourced from different places in different ways. Perhaps in time, as new designs for collaborative practice in Central Highlands and elsewhere unfold these other groups may want to become involved more formally. In the meantime however the proposal is to start with the three groups directly funded by DHHS Central Highlands.\nOf course, anyone who is involved with these networks and wants to be part of discussions and to assist with consideration and design is welcome to come to the Workshop Session.\nAny further questions, please feel free to get in touch with\n\nGreg McIntosh, DHHS Central Highlands, who is a manager at DHHS leading this project g.mcintosh@dhhs.vic.gov.au | 5333 6223\nRenee Smith, DHHS Central Highlands, who is an advisor at DHHS , renee.smith@dhhs.vic.gov.au, 0427 588 014\nDavid McGinniss, an independent consultant who is helping out with this work.

In the meantime however the proposal is to start with the three groups directly funded by DHHS Central Highlands.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, anyone who is involved with these networks and wants to be part of discussions and to assist with consideration and design is welcome to come to the Workshop Session.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Any further questions, please feel free to get in touch with</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><SPAN></SPAN>Greg McIntosh, DHHS Central Highlands, who is a manager at DHHS leading this project <A HREF=\"mailto:g.mcintosh@dhhs.vic.gov.au\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">g.mcintosh@dhhs.vic.gov.au</A> | 5333 6223</LI>\n<LI><SPAN></SPAN>Renee Smith, DHHS Central Highlands, who is an advisor at DHHS , <A HREF=\"mailto:renee.smith@dhhs.vic.gov.au\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">renee.smith@dhhs.vic.gov.au</A>, 0427 588 014</LI>\n<LI><SPAN></SPAN>David McGinniss, an independent consultant who is helping out with this work. <A HREF=\"mailto:David.mcginniss@gmail.com\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">David.mcginniss@gmail.com</A> | 0403 679 277</LI>\n<LI>or</LI>\n<LI><SPAN></SPAN>Your colleagues on the Network Committees and Operational Groups that you are part of</LI>\n</UL>"
