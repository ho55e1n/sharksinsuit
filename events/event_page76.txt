Robyne is a proud Yamatji woman from WA who has lived and worked in Melbourne for thirty-five years. Her professional career traverses two very different paths; her art practice and her work in the university sector, which includes lecturing in both fine art and allied health. http://www.robynelatham.com\r\nRobyne\u2019s Indigenous heritage underpins all her work, and she employs a strengths based approach, through a lens which is non- blaming and non-shaming.\r\nThis PD will begin with an exploration of the Aboriginal construct of Dadirri, (deep listening or listening with all your senses). Participants will explore the Aboriginal History timeline, which will lead into a tour of John Gollings\u2019 exhibition of photographs of Aboriginal ancestral sites, Spirit of Place. The day will conclude with an experiential activity titled The Description is on the Described.\r\nThis PD will address the following standards as listed in the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers towards maintaining Proficient Teacher registration in Victoria.\r\n\r\n2.4 Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Provide opportunities for learners to develop understanding of, and respect for, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 Strategies for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander learners Design and implement effective teaching strategies that are responsive to the local community and cultural setting, linguistic background and histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander learners.\r\n\r\nRecommended for teachers and educators of all year levels and subjects. You do not need specialist art training to use these strategies with students.\r\nAdult $190\u00a0Education Member\u00a0$160\r\nIncludes museum admission, workshop materials, drinks & refreshments from Caf\u00e9 Heide.\r\nVenue\u00a0Sidney Myer Education Centre",

This class will help you to understand two of these newer products, Office 365 Groups and Teams.\nWe cover the specific details of how to use Groups and Teams, while also looking at the bigger picture to help you understand how you might use them in the real world to improve the way you share files and communicate as a business.\nFinally, we discuss the administration process for Groups and Teams, with a review of the management options including security and controlling who can use the tools.\nModule 1: Office 365 the Bigger Picture\nTo provide context to the use and benefits of Office 365 Groups and Teams we need to start with a brief introduction to Office 365. Here we discuss the other major components of Office 365 including Mail, Skype for Business and SharePoint. By realising the limits of these we can start to understand the benefits of Groups and Teams.\n* Overview Office 365\n* Other communication tools in Office 365\n* Browser, client and mobile apps\nModule 2: Getting Started with Groups\nNow we look at Office 365 Groups in detail, everything from who can create them to daily usage scenarios and limitations. Groups can be accessed from Outlook or a web browser so we will demonstrate both.\n* What is a Group?\n* Create a Group\n* Delete a Group\n* Browse Groups\n* Use groups from Outlook and the web browsers\n* Group Membership (Join and Leave)\n* Conversations\n* Email a Group\n* Files and Notebook\n* Planner\n* Connectors\nModule 3: Getting Started with Teams\nNext we look at Teams in detail, again starting with how to create them and including specific usage scenarios. There is some overlap between Group and Teams so here we will focus on what is unique to Teams.\n* What is a Team?\n* Create a new Team\n* Use Teams from the Browser and Client Tools\n* Activity and Chat\n* Channels and Tabs\n* Meetings\n* Files\n* Delete a Team\nModule 4: Groups vs Teams\nDuring modules two and three you have seen how to use Office 365 Groups and Teams, next we compare the two tools to help you decide when it is appropriate to use each, based on criteria such as the type or work being performed and the experience of the users involved.\n* Benefit of Office 365 Groups\n* Benefit of Teams\n* Business Scenarios for comparison\nModule 5: Group and Team Administration\nNow that you have seen how Groups and Teams are used, the final thing you need to know is how to manage them. This will include how to delete and monitor using Office 365 management tools. We will also discuss how to configure the administration setting to ensure Groups and Teams are optimised for your company.\n* Office 365 Admin\n* Delete a Group",
