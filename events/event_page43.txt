This is a program that has created best selling authors, TEDx speakers, and wellness leaders around the world that are now living their life on their terms.\nHere is just a snapshot of what you\u2019ll learn...\n1. MissionWhat is your mission? Mission is at the core of giant companies across the globe and it works for a reason. It is the essence of you, your \u2018WHY\u2019, the reason for your business and the source of your magic to inspire and create a movement.

Through methods like coaching, authoring best-selling books, keynote speaking and so many more.\n\u00a0\n\n\nDo I Qualify?\n\n\n\n\nHere are the basic requirements if you\u2019d like to attend...\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s not for everyone.\n1. You need to have a wellness business that is currently generating revenue.If you are in \u2018idea' phase or just starting out, this is not the best for you (check out our other events that are more suitable). This is for the wellness practitioner achieving some success but struggling to reach the potential they know they have.\n2. You need to have the desire to get out of the old time-for-money business model and step into the freedom based, wellness leader model.If you're comfortable seeing clients one-to-one, trading time for money and working in your clinic day-in-day-out (staying local), then this is not for you. If you want to increase your reach, make a bigger difference on the planet and create time and location freedom so you can do more of the things you love with those that you love, then this is for you.\n3. You need to be willing to roll up your sleeves and put in the work to create the business and lifestyle of your dreams.This is not for the person that thinks sitting in a 3-hour seminar will somehow magically create the change they want in their business and life; the knowledge and systems you'll be exposed to works amazingly (and has helped many people), but only if you work them.\n4. You need to be prepared to invest in yourself and the success of your wellness business.This isn't some seminar training you can pick up anywhere. This is an experience designed for the 1%'s who will take the time, money, energy to get even better results in their business.\n5. Lastly, we have a strict no 'chicken little' policy.If you think the sky is falling or like to whine and complain about anything and everything, then this is not gonna work for you. Life is too short to work with people who are negative and are not willingly to have some fun. This experience is meant to be inspiring, uplifting and be the catalyst for you to step into the best version of yourself.\n\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you and helping you to grow a sustainable and professional wellness business...\nFor more details:\u00a0\nhttp://wellnessleadership.net/3-hour-event/\nPRESENTED BY:\nGlobal Wellness Leadership Experts\n\n\nMarcus has over 20 years experience in the Wellness Industry both as a successful wellness practitioner, clinic owner and online business owner.
