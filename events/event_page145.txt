                "text": "It'a all about what happens after the day shift is done.\nDuring the day my brain is soaking in ideas. The colour of a client's shirt is the perfect shade of grey. The light spills over the wall and shadows fall across the floor. The curves of my wife getting dressed. The people on the street going about their life.\nEveryday stuff informs my art, nothing fancy.\nAll day the colours and textures build up in my brain, and when I get to the studio it all spills out onto the canvas or paper. \nIt's not something I can contain or hold back. \nThe lines appear then the colours and shapes follow. \n\nMy art is an expression of our world. It's a connection to our everyday selves, stripping away all the noise and reimagining what we see. \nMy goal is to create an optional slice of life, a respite from how we view our reality. \nMy ambition is to spark a new conversation or perspective on life as we know it. Our views don't have to agree, in fact that's what I like best! A different opinion, a chance to chat, a moment to reflect and share.\n\nJoin me for Opening Night on Saturday 1st June, from 6pm\nThere will be overflowing grazing tables and bottomless beer, wine and soft drinks\n\nAt 8:00pm we will be announcing the winner of our Silent Auction Prize*, with proceeds going to Rotary's End Polio campaign.\nThe Nightshift Exhibition is open each day from 1st June to 15th June.\nJohn will be in residence from 3:30pm each day until he cleans his brushes and heads home around 8ish. Wekends from around 10ish to roughly 6 or 7ish. Or longer if you bring scotch and pizza.\nSilent Auction - John is donating one of his pieces to raise funds and End Polio. Details will be available on insta and facebook, or shoot John an email for more information: iconicjohn@me.com\nInstagram -\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/iconicjohnart/\n\n\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nAll ages welcome.\u00a0\u00a0\nNote there will be alochol served and nudes on view (art, not real live humans) so if you have delicate sensibilities or children that you wish to shield from adult pleasures please leave them at home with Netflix and Nanna.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nemail: iconicjohn@me.com or\u00a0Insta direct message: @iconicjohnart\nWarning - messages can be slow or incohhrent, depening on time of day and scotch consumed. No responsibility taken for poor grammar or lack of punctuation. Just sayin'.\n\u00a0What's the refund policy?\nUp to 48 hours prior to the event for a full refund. But you may have to buy the artist a scotch to make up for his feeling of loss and rejection. Or just give the ticket to your sister or friend who can make it. Then the artist will never know and you won't have any unnecessary remorse or guilt at letting this poor starving artist down on his big night.\n\u00a0Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nPrinted or on your phone is ok. Or on your friends phone if you have lost yours. Or check the name on your undies before you walk in to make sure it's you and we cn check you off the door list. Whatever works for you, but remembering your name will definitely help.\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket doesn't match the person who attends?\nNo problem at all, we get that sometimes our names don't match our mood or that plans change and your sister can make it but you can't.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

Master hypnotist Wayne Donnelly is testing the mental mettle of Australians at hilarious shows across the country - and anyone could become the star of the show... Have you ever wondered if a person could be hypnotised to commit a crime? And then be hypnotised to forget it all? Does being hypnotised mean you're in thrall forever? What about the \"clucking like a loony chook\" part?\nWayne Donnelly - Hypno Comedian is the ultimate form of entertainment: you and your friends can become the stars of the show in a safe, tasteful and, above all, unforgettable way. Or you could simply choose to watch the on-stage antics! Whichever you prefer, you'll be thinking and talking about your experience long after the curtain falls...\nAudience members don't have to worry about being plucked out and forced to take part, either: \"No one gets picked randomly - audience members get 'tested' for their ability to focus and can volunteer as they wish.\" Hypnotist Wayne Donnelly's show explores the mysteries and conspiracy theories around mind control, using his skills on willing volunteers and audience members ready to take a chance on their own subconscious.\nWayne delves into much-debated scenarios such as the Kennedy assassination and the notorious \"Lizard People\" that some believe surround us, combining these real-life stories with a good dose of drama and comedy. But no, embarrassing poultry episodes are not on the menu! \"That's a clich\u00e9 from the old days,\" laughs Wayne... Although some audience members have been known to ask for it on occasion!\nWayne has been entrancing audiences across Australia, honing his skills and creating new routines and experiences along the way. \"This show illustrates the plasticity of reality, and how your perception of reality can be changed... It highlights the wonder of the mind, but also asks the question: how would your life be if you could harness your mind to improve it?\"\nWayne is a master hypnotist and NLP Master Practitioner whose journey with mind control started in 2008, after a series of hard knocks pushed him to delve deeper into the power of the mind.\nNot only does this father-of-three provide loads of laughs on stage, he's also a qualified hypnotherapist who supports people to change their behaviour for the better, whether it's helping smokers to quit, overweight people to develop healthier habits or encouraging emotional resilience.\nIf you\u2019re curious and would like to volunteer to be hypnotised before any of the shows below, be at the relevant venue an hour before the show starts. Volunteers get a free ticket to the show!",

Have you ever wondered if a person could be hypnotised to commit a crime? And then be hypnotised to forget it all? Does being hypnotised mean you're in thrall forever? What about the \"clucking like a loony chook\" part?</P>\n<P>Wayne Donnelly - Hypno Comedian is the ultimate form of entertainment: you and your friends can become the stars of the show in a safe, tasteful and, above all, unforgettable way. Or you could simply choose to watch the on-stage antics! Whichever you prefer, you'll be thinking and talking about your experience long after the curtain falls...</P>\n<P>Audience members don't have to worry about being plucked out and forced to take part, either: \"No one gets picked randomly - audience members get 'tested' for their ability to focus and can volunteer as they wish.\" Hypnotist Wayne Donnelly's show explores the mysteries and conspiracy theories around mind control, using his skills on willing volunteers and audience members ready to take a chance on their own subconscious.</P>\n<P>Wayne delves into much-debated scenarios such as the Kennedy assassination and the notorious \"Lizard People\" that some believe surround us, combining these real-life stories with a good dose of drama and comedy. But no, embarrassing poultry episodes are not on the menu! \"That's a clich\u00e9 from the old days,\" laughs Wayne... Although some audience members have been known to ask for it on occasion!</P>\n<P>Wayne has been entrancing audiences across Australia, honing his skills and creating new routines and experiences along the way. \"This show illustrates the plasticity of reality, and how your perception of reality can be changed... It highlights the wonder of the mind, but also asks the question: how would your life be if you could harness your mind to improve it?\"</P>\n<P>Wayne is a master hypnotist and NLP Master Practitioner whose journey with mind control started in 2008, after a series of hard knocks pushed him to delve deeper into the power of the mind.</P>\n<P>Not only does this father-of-three provide loads of laughs on stage, he's also a qualified hypnotherapist who supports people to change their behaviour for the better, whether it's helping smokers to quit, overweight people to develop healthier habits or encouraging emotional resilience.</P>\n<P>If you\u2019re curious and would like to volunteer to be hypnotised before any of the shows below, be at the relevant venue an hour before the show starts. Volunteers get a free ticket to the show!</P>"

Held at a time of the year that sees the mountain at its late Autumn best. Misty fog often hides the runner just 10M in front of you on the trail. The moist lush bush and soft trails make it both a pleasure and challenge to traverse. Slips and falls can be common place if you loose your concentration. Exposed temperatures will bite, yet the the sheltered pockets often see the jackets unzipped to get some fresh air. When you run Macedon once you just want more, not immediately but you will be back.\r\nBut the real challenge of the Mt Macedon trails are undoubtably the lack of flat sections. Offering a choice of 10km - 21km - 30km - 42km - 50km distances theres an option for all levels, but beware, we may suggest you take on a shorter option if your not quite up for the challenge that is Mt Macedon. Bring it on..\r\nAnd with our 10th edition in 2020 will you be up for the double?, yes we are working to create that much sort after 100km challenge in serious mountain trails, can you handle a night time start, then join the 50km runners as the sun rises, this may just happen.

We would love to have you helping as a volunteer\r\nWe need aid station helpers and course sweepers,\u00a0there is no greater gift on the trails then helping another runner achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nSupporting CanTeen\r\nAll Trailsplus events donate $1 of each participant's race entry fee to CanTeen, the Australian organisation for Young people Living with cancer. You can choose to donate a little extra during the entry process if you would like too.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRace Schedule\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease note that registration and briefing are both compulsory. \u00a0\r\nBibs and pre-ordered merchandise will be collected at registration.\r\nIf merchandise is not collected, a postage fee will be charged for items to be posted.\r\nStart Times\r\n0730 - 50km\r\n0830 - 42km\r\n0930 - 30km\r\n1030 - 21km\u00a0\r\n1130 - 10km\r\n\r\nsubject to change\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPresentation Times (approx)\r\n\r\nPresentation will take place approx. 30min after 3rd place male/female in each event finish.\r\nHarbisons Picnic area is start finish area and has a BBQ to warm the insides on a cool day.\r\nIf you have performed well and are a podium finisher,\r\nplease allow time to attend the presentation and receive your trophy.\r\nEach winner not only receives a trophy but can also recieve some great sponsor prizes when available,\r\nyou have to be present to receive these additional prizes.\r\nRACE BIBS\r\n\r\nPlease note we do not post out race bibs before the event\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nRace Bibs must be collected on race morning at registration,\u00a0\r\nthis ensures we know who is present on the start line\r\n\u00a0\r\nAn \"Info Pack\" will either be posted on the website or emailed to all competitors\r\nin the\u00a0week leading up to the race if there are any last minute changes that need to be conveyed,\r\notherwise all relevant information can be found on the website.\r\nCup Free Event #goinggreener\r\nWe are a cup free event, we love that our runners are supportive concerned about the waste footprint and overall impact our events have on the environment.

Bring it on..</P>\r\n<P>And with our 10th edition in 2020 will you be up for the double?, yes we are working to create that much sort after 100km challenge in serious mountain trails, can you handle a night time start, then join the 50km runners as the sun rises, this may just happen. As a special one off edition of Macedon Trail Runs, unless you want more..</P>\r\n<P>\u00a0</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>As always Volunteers are the key to successful events</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>If you\u00a0would like to help out on the day please let us know.

                "text": "An Introduction to Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) for Myotherapists\nThe McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) is an evidence-based method used by clinicians around the world. It is a movement-based approach incorporating the latest pain science and patient empowerment principles. The MDT system enables clinicians to confidently assess, subclassify and quickly identify the most appropriate management strategy for spinal and extremity conditions.\nImportant to note:\u00a0McKenzie Institute Australia Courses are open to Physiotherapists, Medical Doctors, Clinical Myotherapists*, Chiropractors, Osteopaths and\u00a0Exercise Physiologists. \u00a0Other health professionals may submit copies of their Tertiary Education and registration details to the McKenzie Institute Australia for consideration.\nAbout the Presenter\nBrett Rawlings is a clinical myotherapist and member of Myotherapy Association Australia. Brett is also a doctor of Chinese medicine and the first myotherapist in Australia to undertake formal training in the McKenzie Method. After completing the MDT Credentialing exam in 2013 Brett decided to embark upon the18-month International Graduate Diploma of MDT. \nIn 2018 he became one of approximately 450 health professionals worldwide to successfully complete this program, which confers the highest level of education and proficiency in the system. Brett is passionate about the McKenzie method and its integration into myotherapy assessment and patient management. In addition to lecturing at SSNT Brett practises from Spine Smart in Malvern and Yarraville.\nAbout the Introductory Session\nThis is not an official component of the MDT educational program, but an introduction to the system aimed at providing participants with a better understanding of its key principles. The course will not include a practical component, however, a live patient demonstration will be performed to demonstrate how this evidence-based assessment and management system can be applied to patients in a myotherapy setting.\nThe course is open to all MAA student and practising members, however, it should be noted that only those members who have completed or are currently enrolled in a bachelor of myotherapy are eligible to undergo formal education in MDT.\nSo if you\u2019re the type of therapist who\u2019s always looking to expand your knowledge and achieve better patient outcomes, here is a great opportunity to gain an introduction into this valuable methodology.\nMA Members will receive\u00a04PDPs\u00a0for this event.\nFAQs\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nPlease send any enquiries to\u00a0events@myotherapy.org.au\n\u00a0What's the refund policy?\n\nMore than 7 calendar days prior to an event start date, a refund less $35 of registration fee (cancellation) will apply. Refunds under such circumstances will only be available 5 days following the staging of the event.\nCancellations made less than 7 calendar days prior to an event start date will not be entitled to a refund under any circumstances.\n",

If you don't have a craft you can hire one of our Aquayak Kayaks for a very small fee (we need to maintain our new fleet so a small fee is now being charged to use our craft) To pre-register and book a craft, simply choose the ticket that refers to what you need and we will see you on the day. Ocean Crusaders will also provide a support vessel on the day to support paddlers and swap bags of rubbish out.\n\nThis is a fun family event and even if you don't have a craft or don't want to hit the water, there is plenty of bank to clean. This event has a 'Bank Clean' ticket option for those staying ashore.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs per usual, we will provide all the cleaning gear, you just provide your sense of adventure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe event is held at the end of Docklands Drive.\u00a0 Simply drive past the Ron Barassi Snr Park and you will end up under the Bolte Bridge.\u00a0 That's where we will be....where the road stops and the creek starts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor more details contact Ian on 0412 932 808 or info@oceancrusaders.org\n",
