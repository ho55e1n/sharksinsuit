In this first part of the session we separate fact from fiction. We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.  Most importantly, we explain the process by which people decide to seek help for their drug\u00a0use and how families can support these decisions.\n  TOPIC 2: STRATEGIES\nBreakThrough isn\u2019t just about ice. We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.  Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.\n TOPIC 3: HELP\nThe last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones. We also look at some of the barriers to seeking help and how to overcome these.  All family members attending the workshop will be given information on where to get help and\u00a0support following the completion of the workshop and options for ongoing support activities.",

A structured opportunity to meet accomplished professionals just like yourself, face to face, one business professional at time. Whether you are an entrepreneur, small business owner, legal or medical professional, in the finance, real estate or entertainment industry - our events offer the perfect occasion to expand your business, social or enterprise contacts. All in a setting and speed - just your style.\nDevoid of typical business networking event staples - we have done away with whistles, bells and over-the-top event trimmings. We feel building business relationships should be a comfortable, sophisticated and relaxed venture. An opportunity to create opportunities.\n\nSpeed Networking @ The Suburban Cellar Door - May 14th 2019\n24 Puckle St, Moonee Ponds VIC 3039, Australia \n7pm - Business Professionals\n\nSpeedMelbourne Networking\nhttps://www.speedmelbournenetworking.com\n\n\nFor questions you may reach us at: 866 WE SPEED\n\n\nHow It Works\nOur hosts will assist you with your SpeedMemphis Networking 'Connect-Card'. After being shown to your table, you will move from business professional to business professional every 5-6 minutes. Simply mark down whom you would be interested in connecting with again on your SpeedMemphis Networking 'Connect-Card' and we'll take care of the rest. You also always have the option of exchanging business cards should you feel so inclined. For those whom garner connections, you will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the event with your 'Connect-Card' results. Once the Speed Networking has completed and all participants have had the opportunity to meet each other - you are welcome to stay and mingle. All we need are the 'Connect-Cards' to determine your business connections.\n\nWhat is SpeedMemphis Networking?\u00a0SpeedMemphis Networking is traditional speed dating - minus the dating. Strictly for business professionals looking to expand their business and social circle. A structured and casually sophisticated offering which allows you to connect to all the participants - five to six minutes at a time. Rotate from business professional to business professional in a comfortable and inviting setting - just your speed.\nWhat type of people can I expect to meet?Accomplished individuals just like yourself.

For every big company breach, there are many smaller companies being attacked and the victim of cyber fraud and data breaches.\u00a0\r\nThese breaches can have a substantial\u00a0and lasting impact on the affected\u00a0businesses and importantly,\u00a0their clients.Our speaker, Scott Mann, will walk you through real life examples\u00a0of what can go wrong, and what has gone wrong, and suggest the lessons\u00a0that should be learnt from them. These lessons\u00a0should help minimise potential\u00a0risks and pitfalls by understanding\u00a0and being aware of common causes of data breaches.This is an important seminar\u00a0for businesses of\u00a0any size that hold sensitive, confidential, personal\u00a0and/or financial\u00a0information\u00a0provided by or on behalf\u00a0of their clients.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nABOUT THE SPEAKER:\r\nScott Mann\u00a0is an industry specialist in computer forensics\u00a0and digital investigations.

Prior to that, as a former\u00a0Detective with the Victorian\u00a0Police Computer Crime Investigation\u00a0Squad, Scott worked closely\u00a0in the search, seizure and examination\u00a0of computer based evidence and crimes.As\u00a0part\u00a0of his directorship\u00a0at Stopline, Scott provides digital investigations support to organisations\u00a0in matters such as computer\u00a0security incident response, Electronic\u00a0discovery, computer\u00a0misuse\u00a0and employment\u00a0disputes, fraud investigations, pro-active threat and risk audits, and search for and collection of data under search orders.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWHERE:\u00a0McKean Park LawyersLevel 11, 575 Bourke StreetMelbourne VIC\u00a03000\r\nWHEN:\u00a0Wednesday, 15 May 20197:30 am for breakfastSeminar 8:00 am - 9:00 am\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
