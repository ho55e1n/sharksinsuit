Unfortunately there is no cure or effective treatment for this disease and therefore HD remains fatal. The onset of symptoms typically occur when a person is in their 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s, and 40\u2019s with death occurring 10-20 years after the initial onset of symptoms. Symptoms include changes to a person\u2019s thinking, feeling, movement, communication, personality and behaviour. Despite advances of global research efforts, an effective treatment and cure for patients has yet to be found.\u00a0Our aimOur ultimate goal is to raise over $50,000 to support the future of HD research which will be held in trust by Huntington\u2019s Victoria and be released for HD research projects. We are raising fund through direct donations and fundraising events to be held throughout the year. This goal is very important to me as I come from a HD family so I have observed the impact of the disease on loved ones and those who care for them.\u00a0\nHow you can helpYou can support the future of HD research by letting your hair down, and having fun at our Lazy Sunday Afternoon event. Bring your friends and family and join us for some music, finger food, raffles and prizes. If you can\u2019t make it, you can still support us. Find out more below.\n\u00a0\nRSVP: 25 April 2019 (preferable to confirm numbers)\nTickets:\u00a0Includes - finger food, entertainment and door prizes \u2013 drinks not included\nCan't make it? You can still donate to HD research through: bit.ly/hunt4aCure\u00a0(donations over $2 are tax deductible)\nQuestions: nickpwalsh@gmail.com\n\u00a0\nThank you for your support and we hope to see you there,\n\u00a0\nNick Walsh\nfor Hunt for a Cure - Lazy Sunday Afternoon Fundraising Committee",

Studying Sacred Female Yoga with Devashi Shakti allowed me to discover a more feminine approach to spiritual practice and to finally embrace myself as a soft and sensitive woman.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am passionate about helping women to:\n\n\n\n\n\n* Slow Down (Learn To Trust The Pace of Your Body Rather Than Your Mind);\n\n\n\n\n\n* Open Up (Become Receptive To Your Own Energy & Inner Reality); &\n\n\n\n\n\n* Let Go (Unhook From Cultural Programming & Self-Negating Beliefs that keep you rushing and unable to relax).\n",

On an emotional level It relieves depression, anxiety, loneliness whilst making us feel held, safe and connected. On a physical level nurturing touch reduces high blood pressure and pain.

If your question is not answered here then please contact me and ask I will be happy to help!\nCuddle Party FAQ\nWhat is a Cuddle Party?\nCuddle Party is a new kind of workshop/social event, that creates a safe place to give and receive non-sexual touch in a fun and affectionate setting.Cuddle Party lets you: * Learn clear and easy communication skills* Set limits simply and straightforwardly* Give and receive enjoyable non-sexual touch in a safe setting, where your boundaries are respected.You can come to a Cuddle Party to meet new people, to enjoy amazing conversations, to touch, to be touched, to have fun, to practice asking for what you want, to practice saying \u201cno\u201d to what you don\u2019t want \u2014 all in a setting structured to be a safe place for exploration and enjoyment. Shucks, you can even come to a Cuddle Party just to cuddle!Cuddle Party is not a sexual event! It\u2019s not a hook-up or dating scene. It\u2019s common to make new friends, and occasionally people have met dating partners, but mostly it\u2019s about friendship and learning nurturing touch.Many Cuddle Parties have an approximate balance of women and men. Sometimes we host parties for particular groups, like women only, or seniors, or singles. We charge a modest fee to cover expenses. Adults only (18 and up).For a longer explanation, check out the article What Is a Cuddle Party? http://www.cuddleparty.com/what-is/\nWhat happens at a Cuddle Party?\nFirst, everyone arrives on time and changes into pyjamas or other comfy clothes.Next, a trained facilitator gently leads you and the other guests through a Welcome Circle and orientation, where you\u2019ll learn to make easy, respectful requests and communicate clear boundaries, and where we\u2019ll go over the simple rules.Everyone agrees to the Cuddle Party Rules, which include:* Pyjamas/ clothes stay on the whole time.* Ask for what you want and get a verbal \u201cyes\u201d before proceeding.* You don\u2019t have to cuddle anyone you don\u2019t want to, or anyone at all, ever.* You are free to leave at any time.Then, you\u2019ll have a couple of hours for free-style cuddle time \u2013 to relax, chat, cuddle, have a snack, or just hang out.Typically, people enjoy foot-rubs, back rubs, spooning, nuzzling, and just generally snuggling up together. Some people like to settle in for a period of time, others like to try shorter times with a variety of people. Usually 3 or 4 or more will end up in something of a \u2018puppy pile\u2019.At the end, we close with a short closing circle.\nWho hosts Cuddle Parties?\nCuddle Parties are hosted by local people who have gone through a training and certification process with the Board of Directors of Cuddle Party.Of course, anyone can invite their friends over to cuddle (We wish more people did), but our Certified Facilitators are trained to teach the participants to make respectful invitations and communicate clear boundaries.Simply put, our Certified Facilitators help a room full of grown-ups in pyjamas feel safe and comfortable while learning new skills and enjoying themselves!\nWho comes to Cuddle Parties?\nSingles - We often have more singles than couples. Singles really appreciate the opportunity to enjoy some simple physical contact without, as one participant said, \u201cgetting into a situation\u201d.Couples \u2013 Couples often find that the short boundary and communication workshop we start each event with actually helps them at home, too.Women \u2013 Women are sometimes afraid they will be expected to be close to someone they don\u2019t want to be. But they always discover that we really mean it when we lead the guests through practice in stating our choices and boundaries (including saying no). Very often, women find the nurturing (with both men and women) to be just what they wanted, but didn\u2019t know was possible, until now.If you\u2019re feeling skeptical about cuddling with men you don\u2019t know, please check out this article \u2013 Women Skeptics http://www.cuddleparty.com/uncategorized/men-are-bastards/#more-162Men \u2013 There is a social idea that men only want sex. It\u2019s not true. Men are just as appreciative of opportunities for non-sexual cuddling as are women. Men are sometimes afraid no one will want to cuddle them. But it hasn\u2019t happened yet! You might like this article \u2013 Real Men Do Cuddle. http://www.cuddleparty.com/uncategorized/real-men-do-cuddle/#more-1Young and Old - We have a wonderful age range at our events, often (20\u2019s to 70\u2019s), and we always hear people appreciating each other.Beginners \u2013 Sometimes people are afraid they won\u2019t know \u2018how\u2019 to cuddle, or will feel awkward. That\u2019s why we help you get started and guide you through some ideas and examples. And by the end of the evening, you\u2019d never know anyone felt awkward a couple of short hours ago!Varsity Cuddlers - These folks dive right to the middle of the puppy pile, are comfortable and relaxed from the start. Their comfort is usually contagious.\nWhat are the rules?\nBefore you arrive:\n*Arrive on time.\n*No drugs or alcohol, period.\nAfter you get there:\n*Clothes stay on the whole time.\n*You don\u2019t have to cuddle anyone you don\u2019t want to.Ask permission and get a verbal yes before touching anyone.\n*If you\u2019re a yes to a request, say YES. If you\u2019re a no, say NO.\n*If you\u2019re a maybe, say NO.\n*You are encouraged to change your mind.\n*Respect your relationship agreements and communicate with your partner.\n*Come get the Cuddle Assistant or me if there is a concern, problem, or if you need assistance with ANYTHING.\n*Tears and laughter are both welcome.\n*Respect people\u2019s privacy when sharing about Cuddle Parties.\n*Keep the cuddle space tidy.\nWhy do I have to be on time?\nThe Welcome Circle orientation establishes our communication and boundary skills for the evening. This creates the clarity and safety that lets everyone relax and know they are on the same page.If you arrive after we begin, sorry, we will not be able to let you in.\nWhat should I wear?\nBring comfy pyjamas to change into. (Of course, you are welcome to wear your pajamas on the way over, if you don\u2019t mind funny looks on the bus) Sweats are fine, but no shorts or tank tops, please. Think less lace, more flannel. No lingerie.Please avoid perfumes and scented products like hairsprays, if possible. This makes it easier to cuddle you!You\u2019re welcome to bring a pillow or teddy bear, too, if you like.\nWhy would I want to cuddle with a bunch of strangers?\nSome people are already comfortable with touch and can\u2019t wait to be in a place where that\u2019s OK. Others aren\u2019t even sure they want any touch at all, but come to explore some communication skills. Others are just curious about what it might be like.Many of our First Time Cuddlers don\u2019t want to cuddle with strangers at all, but during the Welcome Circle find out that many people there have shown up for similar reasons. Once we\u2019ve taken the first step in getting to know one another, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to want to reach out and rub someone\u2019s shoulders, or ask for a hug.Whatever your reasons, a Cuddle Party is a great playground for discovering more about yourself, for exploring new ways of connecting with others, or simply enjoying a relaxing, cozy evening with other cuddly souls.\nWhy would anyone need to learn how to cuddle?\nWe have found, at the hundreds of parties we have facilitated, that it is not the cuddling that most people come to learn. It is the boundaries and communication skills that are most appreciated by our guests. Once boundaries, choice and communication become easier, the cuddling happens quite naturally.It is always a joy to see a group of relative strangers, some of whom feel a little awkward at the beginning, relax and enjoy themselves together, and by the end of the evening feel quite cozy and satisfied.\nDo I have to Cuddle with everyone? What if I just want to cuddle with certain people?\nYou absolutely do not have to cuddle with anyone you don\u2019t want to, ever. And it\u2019s fine to choose and invite only those people that interest you or you feel safe with.It is helpful though, to remember that it\u2019s not a dating scene. Most people are surprised at how comfortable they are with most everybody, once the Welcome Circle has clarifies the Rules and set the tone.\nWhat if no one wants to cuddle with me?\nEveryone, including you, has a choice about who and how to share touch. That means that there may be people who say \u2018No\u2019 to your invitation.However, it has not happened yet that a guest finds no one willing to cuddle with them.Even if it did, you can always ask your Facilitator for some help and support.\nIs this a singles event?\nIt\u2019s not a hook-up or dating scene. It\u2019s common to make new friends, and occasionally people have met dating partners, but mostly it\u2019s about friendship and learning nurturing touch.\nHow can I be assured that everyone will respect my choices?\nOur Certified Cuddle Party Facilitators are trained to use the Welcome Circle orientation to establish the boundary agreements and teach communication skills for the evening. We go through the Rules of Cuddling and a few exercises for practicing the skills of asking, communicating and respecting other\u2019s choices.Even so, it is possible that someone at the event may goof. We are all humans! This is where you get to use the communications tools you have just learned.And of course, please ask the Facilitator for help with anything, at any time.\nWhat about sex? Isn\u2019t cuddling about sex?\nOur society is a little confused (or a lot!) about the nature of touch and sex.All touch, and all cuddling, is not about sex. Sadly, in a society in which they get lumped together, most people have very little opportunity for touch or cuddling that isn\u2019t part of sex. We believe this is a great loss.Human beings of all ages need touch and affection. We never outgrow it. As we re-discover non-sexual touch and affection, find a spacious and generous opportunity to enjoy and explore kindness and human affection with others. And we have more fun.Cuddle Party is specifically designed to leave the sexual kinds of touch off the menu, so that the more inclusive, non-sexual kinds of touch have a chance to be found and enjoyed.Many people find this quite natural. For others, it\u2019s a new experience, or even challenging. Many people are surprised to find such a rich, comforting, playful and fun experience.\nAnd what if I get turned on?\nIt happens sometimes. It\u2019s perfectly normal when we are close to people, especially if we don\u2019t have much chance to enjoy touch that is not about sex.Our agreement is to not act on it. It goes away, really it does.\nAre the events gender-balanced?\nEach of our Certified Facilitators arranges their own events and chooses whether or not to attempt to gender balance. Some do and some don\u2019t, and individual events can vary as well. Please see the listing for that party.Cuddle Parties are not about sex and not about coupling up, and therefore gender is of very little consequence. Most people think they need a balance, but are quite surprised at how little difference it makes.However, we realize that it\u2019s a question that comes up, and many people are just not yet at the place where they are comfortable with people of the \u2018wrong\u2019 gender. It\u2019s understandable and deserves some thought.\nWhy should I have to pay for cuddling?\nYou don\u2019t! No one could possibly charge for cuddling. You are welcome to invite friends and family to cuddle any time at all!What is unique about a Cuddle Party is that because it is a facilitated experience, most people feel safe enough to attend with people they don\u2019t know. And they are right. Our Certified Facilitators create safety by leading the Welcome Circle, which teaches communication and boundary skills and helps everyone get comfortable, and by remaining available for any concerns that may arise. Without an event they can trust, most people are not likely to go to a stranger\u2019s house for a cuddle.It can help to recall that when you visit a night club, you don\u2019t pay to dance. You pay for the space, atmosphere, band and janitor, and in case you need it, the bouncer. The dancing is up to you.Besides the cost of training and certification, the responsibilities of hosting Cuddle Parties includes the creation and maintaining of websites, newsletters and other forms of promotion, and answering questions via phone and email.The facilitator/host prepares the space, buys and prepares snacks, leads the guests through the mini-workshop, meets any concerns or problems that arise, and cleans up after the event. All in all, the work of hosting an average Cuddle Party takes about as long as the party itself.Because of all this, we believe it is fair for our Certified Facilitators to be paid for their time and responsibilities.\nWhy can\u2019t I bring my kids?\nCuddle Parties are for adults to relax. 18 and up, for legal and safety reasons.We do, however have a few Certified Facilitators who are pioneering Family CP\u2019s, where a limited number of children are allowed with their parents. Not all Facilitators have the option to try this. If this interests you, contact us at Cuddle Party HQ.\nAre Cuddle Parties therapy?\nCuddle Parties are not therapy. But they can be healing, comforting, restorative, rejuvenating, inspiring, insight-producing, and challenging of your preconceived ideas. And they are almost always playful and fun.Many people have found a deep support and growth in self awareness and relationship skills. Others are fine with where they are, and come just for the fun of it.They are intended for people who are basically well. People who need professional help respecting boundaries \u2013 their own or others\u2019 \u2013 should consult trained health care professionals.\nSo . . . Do the pyjamas really stay on?\nYep!",

This makes it easier to cuddle you!<BR>You\u2019re welcome to bring a pillow or teddy bear, too, if you like.</P>\n<P><BR>Why would I want to cuddle with a bunch of strangers?</P>\n<P>Some people are already comfortable with touch and can\u2019t wait to be in a place where that\u2019s OK. Others aren\u2019t even sure they want any touch at all, but come to explore some communication skills. Others are just curious about what it might be like.<BR>Many of our First Time Cuddlers don\u2019t want to cuddle with strangers at all, but during the Welcome Circle find out that many people there have shown up for similar reasons. Once we\u2019ve taken the first step in getting to know one another, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to want to reach out and rub someone\u2019s shoulders, or ask for a hug.<BR>Whatever your reasons, a Cuddle Party is a great playground for discovering more about yourself, for exploring new ways of connecting with others, or simply enjoying a relaxing, cozy evening with other cuddly souls.</P>\n<P><BR>Why would anyone need to learn how to cuddle?</P>\n<P>We have found, at the hundreds of parties we have facilitated, that it is not the cuddling that most people come to learn. It is the boundaries and communication skills that are most appreciated by our guests. Once boundaries, choice and communication become easier, the cuddling happens quite naturally.<BR>It is always a joy to see a group of relative strangers, some of whom feel a little awkward at the beginning, relax and enjoy themselves together, and by the end of the evening feel quite cozy and satisfied.</P>\n<P><BR>Do I have to Cuddle with everyone? What if I just want to cuddle with certain people?</P>\n<P>You absolutely do not have to cuddle with anyone you don\u2019t want to, ever. And it\u2019s fine to choose and invite only those people that interest you or you feel safe with.<BR>It is helpful though, to remember that it\u2019s not a dating scene. Most people are surprised at how comfortable they are with most everybody, once the Welcome Circle has clarifies the Rules and set the tone.</P>\n<P><BR>What if no one wants to cuddle with me?</P>\n<P>Everyone, including you, has a choice about who and how to share touch. That means that there may be people who say \u2018No\u2019 to your invitation.<BR>However, it has not happened yet that a guest finds no one willing to cuddle with them.<BR>Even if it did, you can always ask your Facilitator for some help and support.</P>\n<P><BR>Is this a singles event?</P>\n<P>It\u2019s not a hook-up or dating scene. It\u2019s common to make new friends, and occasionally people have met dating partners, but mostly it\u2019s about friendship and learning nurturing touch.</P>\n<P><BR>How can I be assured that everyone will respect my choices?</P>\n<P>Our Certified Cuddle Party Facilitators are trained to use the Welcome Circle orientation to establish the boundary agreements and teach communication skills for the evening. We go through the Rules of Cuddling and a few exercises for practicing the skills of asking, communicating and respecting other\u2019s choices.<BR>Even so, it is possible that someone at the event may goof. We are all humans! This is where you get to use the communications tools you have just learned.<BR>And of course, please ask the Facilitator for help with anything, at any time.</P>\n<P><BR>What about sex? Isn\u2019t cuddling about sex?</P>\n<P>Our society is a little confused (or a lot!) about the nature of touch and sex.<BR>All touch, and all cuddling, is not about sex. Sadly, in a society in which they get lumped together, most people have very little opportunity for touch or cuddling that isn\u2019t part of sex. We believe this is a great loss.<BR>Human beings of all ages need touch and affection. We never outgrow it. As we re-discover non-sexual touch and affection, find a spacious and generous opportunity to enjoy and explore kindness and human affection with others. And we have more fun.<BR>Cuddle Party is specifically designed to leave the sexual kinds of touch off the menu, so that the more inclusive, non-sexual kinds of touch have a chance to be found and enjoyed.<BR>Many people find this quite natural. For others, it\u2019s a new experience, or even challenging. Many people are surprised to find such a rich, comforting, playful and fun experience.</P>\n<P><BR>And what if I get turned on?</P>\n<P>It happens sometimes. It\u2019s perfectly normal when we are close to people, especially if we don\u2019t have much chance to enjoy touch that is not about sex.<BR>Our agreement is to not act on it. It goes away, really it does.</P>\n<P><BR>Are the events gender-balanced?</P>\n<P>Each of our Certified Facilitators arranges their own events and chooses whether or not to attempt to gender balance. Some do and some don\u2019t, and individual events can vary as well. Please see the listing for that party.<BR>Cuddle Parties are not about sex and not about coupling up, and therefore gender is of very little consequence. Most people think they need a balance, but are quite surprised at how little difference it makes.<BR>However, we realize that it\u2019s a question that comes up, and many people are just not yet at the place where they are comfortable with people of the \u2018wrong\u2019 gender. It\u2019s understandable and deserves some thought.</P>\n<P>Why should I have to pay for cuddling?</P>\n<P>You don\u2019t! No one could possibly charge for cuddling. You are welcome to invite friends and family to cuddle any time at all!<BR>What is unique about a Cuddle Party is that because it is a facilitated experience, most people feel safe enough to attend with people they don\u2019t know. And they are right. Our Certified Facilitators create safety by leading the Welcome Circle, which teaches communication and boundary skills and helps everyone get comfortable, and by remaining available for any concerns that may arise. Without an event they can trust, most people are not likely to go to a stranger\u2019s house for a cuddle.<BR>It can help to recall that when you visit a night club, you don\u2019t pay to dance. You pay for the space, atmosphere, band and janitor, and in case you need it, the bouncer. The dancing is up to you.<BR>Besides the cost of training and certification, the responsibilities of hosting Cuddle Parties includes the creation and maintaining of websites, newsletters and other forms of promotion, and answering questions via phone and email.<BR>The facilitator/host prepares the space, buys and prepares snacks, leads the guests through the mini-workshop, meets any concerns or problems that arise, and cleans up after the event. All in all, the work of hosting an average Cuddle Party takes about as long as the party itself.<BR>Because of all this, we believe it is fair for our Certified Facilitators to be paid for their time and responsibilities.</P>\n<P>Why can\u2019t I bring my kids?</P>\n<P>Cuddle Parties are for adults to relax. 18 and up, for legal and safety reasons.<BR>We do, however have a few Certified Facilitators who are pioneering Family CP\u2019s, where a limited number of children are allowed with their parents. Not all Facilitators have the option to try this. If this interests you, contact us at Cuddle Party HQ.</P>\n<P>Are Cuddle Parties therapy?</P>\n<P>Cuddle Parties are not therapy. But they can be healing, comforting, restorative, rejuvenating, inspiring, insight-producing, and challenging of your preconceived ideas. And they are almost always playful and fun.<BR>Many people have found a deep support and growth in self awareness and relationship skills. Others are fine with where they are, and come just for the fun of it.<BR>They are intended for people who are basically well. People who need professional help respecting boundaries \u2013 their own or others\u2019 \u2013 should consult trained health care professionals.</P>\n<P><BR>So . . . Do the pyjamas really stay on?</P>\n<P>Yep!</P>"

                "text": "\nANU Drill Hall Gallery welcomes you to our\u00a0six\u00a0part\u00a0LECTURE SERIES\u00a02019\nThis year\u2019s Lecture Series focuses on the written word. It revisits \u201cfoundational texts\u201d relating to the visual arts. Some of these texts provided key terms which have supplied the criteria of appreciation and criticism over many centuries. Others proposed cognitive frameworks which became the ground-rules of scholarship and helped create the institutions we know today. Yet others record individual writers\u2019 responses to the provocative novelty of the art of their day.\n1: SUNDAY 3 MARCH 3 - 4pm\nChristopher Allen\nThe Perennial Search for Words: Aesthetics, Art Criticism and Commentary since antiquity\nThis introduction considers the elementary terminology and descriptive language pertaining to art in ancient times. It also highlights the enduring ideas which have prevailed since antiquity. Christopher Allen is art critic for The Australian and Senior Master in Academic Extension at Sydney Grammar School.\n2: SUNDAY 7 APRIL 3 - 4pm\nTerence Maloon \nLorenzo Ghiberti : The Commentaries\nThe ground-breaking writings of the 15th century Florentine artist are categorised by art historian Francis Ames-Lewis as the \u201cfirst coherent history of Italian art, the first artistic autobiography and the first attempt by an artist to discuss in words some of the intellectual and scientific principles of the visual arts, notably optics.\u201d Ghiberti\u2019s Commentaries provided an influential rationale for \u201cthe Renaissance.\u201d Terence Maloon is Director of the ANU Drill Hall Gallery.\n3: SUNDAY 5 MAY 3 - 4pm\nLouise Marshall\nHeinrich W\u0151lfflin\nWith the advent of W\u00f6lfflin comes a complex, nuanced descriptive language specifically adapted to art history and criticism, enlarging the writer\u2019s capacity to analyse style and account for sharp changes of idiom (which were, in effect, changes of \u201cworld view\u201d). Louise Marshall is a senior lecturer in the Department of Art History, University of Sydney. \n4: SUNDAY 7 JULY 3 - 4pm\nPeter Kohane \nVitruvius and his interpreters \nThis lecture traces the Renaissance rediscovery of a text on architecture dating from the 1st century BC and the recasting of its dry terminology by erudite and eloquent later writers such as Leon Battista Alberti. The augmentation of their ideas resulted in the steady enrichment of architectural aesthetics. Peter Kohane is senior lecturer, Architectural Studies, at the University of New South Wales.\n5: SUNDAY 4 AUGUST 3 - 4pm\nJennifer Milam\nSir Joshua Reynolds and the language of the academy\nThe founding director of the Royal Academy in London, Sir Joshua Reynolds, had an outstanding knowledge of Old Master paintings, as displayed in his erudite Discourses. His text exemplified not only the critical language of the academy, but also some surprising deviations from its dogmas. Jennifer Milam is the Head of School and Professor of Art History in the School of Culture and Communications, at the University of Melbourne. \n6: SUNDAY 1\u200a SEPTEMBER\u00a0 3 - 4pm\nTerence Maloon\nWriters on Monet\nMonet\u2019s art was so novel that his commentators felt obliged to respond with equivalent freshness and eccentricity. This lecture surveys some great texts inspired by Monet, by writers including Maupassant, Proust, Roger Marx, Louis Gillet and Virginia Spate. Terence Maloon is Director of the ANU Drill Hall Gallery.\n\u00a0\nAll lectures are held at ANU SCHOOL OF ART & DESIGN LECTURE THEATRE at 3pm: \nLevel 1, Childers Street entrance\nTICKETS $10 / $5 (student), FRIENDS of the Drill Hall Gallery FREE\nFor more information see our website dhg.anu.edu.au",

It's a time to\u00a0plant new seeds or replenish the soil of the garden of your dreams and goals.\nJoin Abby Lee of Qigong Melbourne for a mini New Moon ritual, group vocal toning (time permitting), gentle movement to prepare the body, followed by a deeply relaxing and nurturing sound meditation. In this deep peaceful state you can let your intentions be gently impressed upon your sub-conscious mind, to be followed by your conscious actions. Together, your dreams and goals can be supercharged.\nImagine letting the soothing and healing sound of crystal bowls, Tibetan bowls, Tibetan gong, melodic chimes, Burmese pagoda bells, medicine drums and more take you on a journey of deep relaxation and rejuvenation. Allow the vibration of these harmonious sounds wash through your body and mind to help release any tensions or blockages, restore your balance and harmony, renew your vitality and serenity. Walk lightly away after the session feeling relaxed, re-centered and re-energised.\n\u00a0\nThis is what Nicki said about her experience of our New Moon Sound Meditation:\n\n\u201cWhether it is simple relaxation or a deeper spiritual experience you seek, the group sound meditations guided by Abby are almost certain to provide nourishment. At the very least, they are training sessions in mindfulness of body, breath and feeling.\nEach meditation and group carry with them a different energy, making no two sound meditations the same.
