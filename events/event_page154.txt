In recent years, there has been a renewed engagement with citizen and community media enterprises to provide a platform to local voices, including those of youth, women, seniors, culturally and linguistically diverse groups and other marginalised groups in society. New media technologies have been a blessing in disguise, imposing a cost on traditional community broadcasting enterprises, and yet removing entry barriers for citizens/individuals to become part of the community media landscape.</P>\r\n<P>This conference explores how citizen and community media enterprises can be enhanced and their capabilities improved through new technologies, policies, infrastructures and collaborations, and tackling any hindrances to such innovation. The conference also provides a space for sharing of experiences and knowledge in citizen and community media enterprises across national borders.</P>\r\n<P><BR></P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Website:</STRONG> <A TITLE=\"Citizen and Community Media International Conference 2019\" HREF=\"https://adi.deakin.edu.au/events/citizen-and-community-media-international-conference\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://adi.deakin.edu.au/events/citizen-and-community-media-international-conference</A></P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Contact:</STRONG> <A HREF=\"mailto:citizenmediaconference2019@deakin.edu.au\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><STRONG><EM>citizenmediaconference2019@deakin.edu.au</EM></STRONG></A></P>\r\n<P>or Dr Usha M.

Despite evidence that they are performing well they can still have that lurking fear that at any moment someone is going to tap them on the shoulder and say \"We need to have a chat\".\r\nThe session will explain why high performing people often doubt their abilities and find it hard to enjoy their successes. It will also show the links to perfectionism and self-handicapping strategies such as procrastination, avoidance and overcommitment.\r\nAt the end of this session you will:\r\n\r\nknow what the latest psychological research tells us about the imposter syndrome is and how it operates\r\nrealise how widespread imposter feelings are and why highly successful people can feel like frauds\r\nbe aware of evidence-based strategies that reduce imposter feelings\r\n\r\n\u00a0This session will be presented by Hugh Kearns from Thinkwell. \r\n\u00a0http://www.ithinkwell.com.au/services-imposter-syndrome\r\nHugh Kearns is recognised internationally as a public speaker, educator and researcher.
