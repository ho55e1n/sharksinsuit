Repetition is the mother of mastery. This, and the sense of consistency, help to pave the way to a soothed nervous system and a calm mind.

He then pursued his higher education at the Vrindavan Gurukul from 1979 to 1984, where he studied all aspects of Bhakti Yoga including Bhakti Shastri and Bhakti Vaibhav, which are higher ladder of spiritual science of the soul and its creation. His father was a tantric yogi and a natural healer through mantras and plant-based medicines.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe first came to Sydney in 1984 and then started travelling around the USA and Europe from 1991.

                "text": "Motivating Boys is an event for boys aged 11-17 and their parents.\nDo you worry about your son\u2019s behaviour or attitude; or maybe he needs help building his confidence?\nDoes your son struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr maybe you're tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse get no response at all?\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. Unfortunately this often leads to various problems at home, at school and with friends both on & off line.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motivating Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8?\nJohn is a youth specialist with over 26 years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across South East Victoria. Through the \"Ride of Life\" & Raging Bull seminars, delivered in schools, John has helped influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nWhilst the clich\u00e9 statement \"Boys will be boys\" is a often used to explain why boys do silly things, as a personal coach/mentor and parent himself, John would rather see this statement reflect a different sentiment. John and his company, Motov8, aim to inspire boys to choose to become awesome young men rather than just accept what others say they will be.\u00a0 \nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ting Boys?\nMotov8ting Boys' is an event for Pre-teen and Teenage Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; to assist them to understand the power of positive attitude, develop confidence, change destructive behaviour, Identify personal potential & understand the importance of self respect & respecting others. \nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's this same reason they don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nSo after talking with school principals, community leaders & parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking & screaming.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.\nThere will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 & KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt & road racing.\nWhat parents are saying about this event.\nClaire Kelly A friend suggested it and I just had that immediate gut feeling, that we had to take our boys. So, with real effort we dragged 3 tired boys out, not really knowing what to expect. It was great! When we got in the car afterwards, one of them said: \"Now that was surprisingly good, I actually really enjoyed it\"; and the other 2 agreed. Win! Thank you Rev! We will def be interested in further workshops.\nSeona Maybery My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2.5hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So so much to take away from this workshop. \nSo turn off the TV, Xbox or PS4 and bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some good advice that could just change your and their lives forever.",

Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>So after talking with school principals, community leaders &amp; parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking &amp; screaming.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>This event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>There will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 &amp; KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt &amp; road racing.<BR></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN></SPAN><STRONG>What parents are saying about this event.</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Claire Kelly </STRONG><SPAN>A friend suggested it and I just had that immediate gut feeling, that we had to take our boys. So, with real effort we dragged 3 tired boys out, not really knowing what to expect. It was great! When we got in the car afterwards, one of them said: \"Now that was surprisingly good, I actually really enjoyed it\"; and the other 2 agreed. Win! Thank you Rev! We will def be interested in further workshops.<SPAN CLASS=\"_47e3 _5mfr\" TITLE=\"smile emoticon\"></SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><STRONG>Seona Maybery</STRONG> My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2.5hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So so much to take away from this workshop. <BR></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>So turn off the TV, Xbox or PS4 and bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some good advice that could just change your and their lives forever.</SPAN></P>"

Each pairing has a shared side table for food & drink (please see below). Seating allocation is on a first come, first served basis.\r\nHow do I find the Fonda Rooftop Cinema?\r\nOur rooftop cinema is located directly above Fonda Windsor, at 144 Chapel St, Windsor. Please enter through the restaurant and the Fonda team will show you up to the rooftop.\r\nWhat time does the event start each night?\u00a0\r\nThe cinema doors will be open from 7.30pm, with screenings due to commence at 8pm.\r\nWe suggest arriving as early as possible to reserve your preferred seats and to enjoy a few drinks (and/or food), before the movie kicks off either in our restaurant (open daily from 11.30am) or in our upstairs Atico bar (opens nightly from 7pm).\r\nWe also have our Fonda happy hours too for those that are super keen - $4 beers, $5 ros\u00e9s and $6 frozen margs, from 4pm to 6pm, everyday if you want to head in early.\r\nWhat's the go with food and drink?\u00a0\r\nThere are a number of ways to enjoy your Fonda favourites either prior to, or during the movie.\u00a0\r\nYour food and drinks can be sorted at the time of purchasing your tickets, with the $45 and $125 ticketing options both including Set Menus that will be delivered directly to your beanbag throughout the movie.\r\nAlternatively, food and drinks can be easily ordered directly from (and delivered to) your beanbag throughout the duration of the movie. Please note that only card payments can be accepted for food and drink orders taken during the screenings.\r\nThe other option is of course to eat in our Windsor restaurant prior to the movie starting.\r\nPlease note that strictly no outside food or drink can be brought in.\r\nWhat should I wear?\r\nWhile the The Fonda Rooftop Cinema is an outdoor event, we do have a retractable roof and heaters should the weather turn bad. There'll also be a blanket provided with each bean bag.\r\nWe do still recommend\u00a0checking the weather forecast ahead of time, and\u00a0bringing some layers if needed.\r\nWhat happens if I can no longer attend?\r\nAll bookings are final at checkout. Please check the session details and movie carefully before booking. If you can no longer attend, please feel free to give your ticket to a friend to use - tickets are fully transferrable for any given session.\r\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\r\nPrinted tickets or tickets on your mobile device will both be accepted.\r\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\r\nFonda Rooftop Cinema screenings are 18+ events. Those under 18 years of age will only be\u00a0permitted\u00a0when accompanied by a\u00a0parent\u00a0or legal guardian.\r\nWhat happens if the weather is bad?\r\nLiving in Melbourne, we're all used to having the unpredictable weather throwing a spanner in the works from time to time. Thankfully our Rooftop cinema has a retractable roof that can handle most inclement weather conditions.\r\nIf however the weather gets a little too wild, we reserve the right to cancel. We will try to do this as early as possible, but due to Melbourne\u2019s rapidly changing weather this may be any stage up until the screening time. This decision is at the discretion of the Venue Manager, with the safety of our guests being at the forefront of the decision making process.\r\nIn the event a session is cancelled you will receive an email & sms with as much notice as possible. Refunds will be processed through Eventbrite, and will take 3 to 5 business days to appear in your account. Any issues or enquiries please email fiesta@fondamexican.com.au",

Please enter through the restaurant and the Fonda team will show you up to the rooftop.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What time does the event start each night?\u00a0</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>The cinema doors will be open from 7.30pm, with screenings due to commence at 8pm.</P>\r\n<P>We suggest arriving as early as possible to reserve your preferred seats and to enjoy a few drinks (and/or food), before the movie kicks off either in our restaurant (open daily from 11.30am) or in our upstairs Atico bar (opens nightly from 7pm).</P>\r\n<P>We also have our Fonda happy hours too for those that are super keen - $4 beers, $5 ros\u00e9s and $6 frozen margs, from 4pm to 6pm, everyday if you want to head in early.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What's the go with food and drink?\u00a0</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>There are a number of ways to enjoy your Fonda favourites either prior to, or during the movie.\u00a0<BR></P>\r\n<P>Your food and drinks can be sorted at the time of purchasing your tickets, with the $45 and $125 ticketing options both including Set Menus that will be delivered directly to your beanbag throughout the movie.</P>\r\n<P>Alternatively, food and drinks can be easily ordered directly from (and delivered to) your beanbag throughout the duration of the movie. Please note that only card payments can be accepted for food and drink orders taken during the screenings.<BR></P>\r\n<P>The other option is of course to eat in our Windsor restaurant prior to the movie starting.</P>\r\n<P>Please note that strictly no outside food or drink can be brought in.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What should I wear?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>While the The Fonda Rooftop Cinema is an outdoor event, we do have a retractable roof and heaters should the weather turn bad. There'll also be a blanket provided with each bean bag.</P>\r\n<P>We do still recommend\u00a0checking the weather forecast ahead of time, and\u00a0bringing some layers if needed.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What happens if I can no longer attend?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>All bookings are final at checkout. Please check the session details and movie carefully before booking. If you can no longer attend, please feel free to give your ticket to a friend to use - tickets are fully transferrable for any given session.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Printed tickets or tickets on your mobile device will both be accepted.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Fonda Rooftop Cinema screenings are 18+ events. Those under 18 years of age will only be\u00a0permitted\u00a0when accompanied by a\u00a0parent\u00a0or legal guardian.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What happens if the weather is bad?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Living in Melbourne, we're all used to having the unpredictable weather throwing a spanner in the works from time to time. Thankfully our Rooftop cinema has a retractable roof that can handle most inclement weather conditions.</P>\r\n<P>If however the weather gets a little too wild, we reserve the right to cancel. We will try to do this as early as possible, but due to Melbourne\u2019s rapidly changing weather this may be any stage up until the screening time. This decision is at the discretion of the Venue Manager, with the safety of our guests being at the forefront of the decision making process.</P>\r\n<P>In the event a session is cancelled you will receive an email &amp; sms with as much notice as possible. Refunds will be processed through Eventbrite, and will take 3 to 5 business days to appear in your account. Any issues or enquiries please email fiesta@fondamexican.com.au</P>"
