Democratic but elitist, emancipatory but coercive, advanced and assimilationist, Progressivism was defined by its contradictions. In a bold new argument, Marilyn Lake points to the significance of turn-of-the-twentieth-century exchanges between American and Australasian reformers who shared racial sensibilities, along with a commitment to forging an ideal social order. Progressive New World demonstrates that race and reform were mutually supportive as Progressivism became the political logic of settler colonialism.\n\n\nIn Conversation:\u00a06-7pm\n\n\nReception & Book Signing:\u00a07-8pm\n\n\n\nProfessor Marilyn Lake AO FAHA FASSA is Professorial Fellow in History at the University of Melbourne. She has held Visiting Fellowships at ANU, the University of Sydney, Stockholm University and the University of Maryland. Between 2001 and 2002 she held the Visiting Chair in Australian Studies in the History department at Harvard University.\nProfessor Lake has published widely on the histories of citizenship, nation, empire, and war. She has published on the history of campaigns for sexual and racial equality for academic presses as well as local newspapers. Recent books include the prize-winning 'Drawing the Global Colour Line: White Men's Countries and the International Challenge of Racial Equality' (Cambridge, 2008) co-authored with Henry Reynolds and 'Progressive New World: How Settler Colonialism and TransPacific Exchange Shaped American Reform' published this year by Harvard University Press.\nProfessor Lake served as President of the Australian Historical Association between 2010 and 2014. She is a Fellow of the Academies of Humanities and Social Sciences.\nProfessor Frank Bongiorno\u00a0AM FASSA is Head of the ANU School of History.

                "text": "\n\nWe are all intimately acquainted with our conscious thoughts, feelings, memories, imaginings and even dreams. Yet consciousness remains one of the biggest mysteries of the human brain.\nHuman consciousness, our perception of what exists as well as our thoughts, feelings, imaginings and dreams has attempted to be understood by philosophers through conceptual analysis and thought experiments. Neuroscientists have sought to describe it as a biological process of neuronal activity captured by measurable tests of brain activity. \u00a0Increasingly, philosophers and neuroscientists are also joining forces in interdisciplinary consciousness science. \u00a0\nConsensus is elusive. Do we experience consciousness only while we are awake? Do other animals experience consciousness? Does it fade after brain damage? Are intelligent computers conscious? Is consciousness a process? \u00a0What is it for?\nWe have invited a neuroscientist and philosopher to share their research and perspectives on consciousness and to provide some guidance on these questions.\u00a0\nAssociate Professor Nao Tsuchiya is researching the neuronal mechanisms of consciousness at Monash University\u2019s Institute of Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences.\u00a0Dr Jennifer Windt is a philosopher who studies the philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science at Monash University. She\u2019s particularly interested in conscious experience during sleep, including dreaming, and its relationship to wake states such as mind wandering, imagination, hallucination, and full-body illusions.\n\nOUR SPEAKERS\nAssociate Professor Naotsugu Tsuchiya\n\nTowards the physical basis of consciousness\nOur subjective conscious experience is supported by neural activities in the brain. Although questions about consciousness have puzzled humanity for centuries, an empirical scientific research program, which aims to identify the neural correlates of consciousness, has started relatively recently, only a few decades ago. As such, we are still far from answering the fascinating questions about consciousness, such as: Can we tell unconscious people from conscious ones, just based on neural activity in the brain? Is each one of us consciously experiencing the world in the same way - Can we determine if my \u201cred\u201d color sensation is the same as yours, based on neural measures? Do newborn babies, animals, insects, plants and future artificial intelligence have consciousness? In this talk, I will discuss recent progress on scientific research on\u00a0 onsciousness, which paves possible ways to address these seemingly philosophical questions with empirical neuroscientific methods. In the future we may arrive at the theory of consciousness to answer these questions.\nDr Tsuchiya was awarded a PhD at California Institute of Technology in 2006. In 2012, he joined the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University as an Associate Professor. His main research interest is to uncover the physical basis of consciousness. Specifically, he focuses on:\u00a01) the scope and limit of non-conscious processing,\u00a02) the relationship between attention and consciousness,\u00a03) the neuronal correlates of consciousness and\u00a04) testing a theory of consciousness, in particular, integrated informationtheory of consciousness. Combining empirical, computational and theoretical research methods through interdisciplinary collaborations, he hopes to solve to the problem of consciousness.\n\nDr Jennifer M. Windt\n\nHow sleep and dream research are revolutionizing our understanding of our conscious\u00a0minds\nWhat happens to conscious experience as we slip from wakefulness into sleep and dreams? Do we dream throughout the night, or are parts of sleep unconscious? How do fluctuations in sleep- related experience align with different sleep stages? And what do these changes tell us about consciousness? In my talk, I\u2019ll review findings from the science of sleep and dreaming and argue that in many ways, they are revolutionizing our understanding of sleep and its relation to consciousness; they also require us to rethink the relation between sleep and wakefulness as well as new methodologies for their investigation.\u00a0Sleep is not a period of uniform passivity and rest characterized by a loss of consciousness. Instead, sleep is heterogeneous, active, and teems with different kinds of experience. Investigating how changes in conscious experience, including dreaming, arise from local changes in brain activity promises to enrich our image of our minds. It can also help identify the neural correlates of conscious experience and may shed light on the minimal requirements for subjective experience.\nJennifer M. Windt is a lecturer in philosophy and senior research fellow at Monash University. Her research centers on philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science. She is particularly interested in mental states in which we disengage from ongoing tasks and the environment. These include mind wandering and spontaneous thought in wakefulness, but also dreaming and other sleep-related experiences as well as sleep-wake transitions. Her research is informed by empirical research findings and interdisciplinary collaborations. She is the author of Dreaming (2015, MIT) and together with Thomas Metzinger edited Open MIND (2016, MIT; an open access version is available at open-mind.net). She is currently working on a research project on mind wandering across the sleep-wake cycle funded by the Australian Research Council.\nDate: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Tuesday, 7 May 2019\nVenue: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Auditorium, Monash Biomedical ImagingMonash University770 Blackburn RoadClayton\nTime:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a06.00pm \u2013 7.30pmRefreshments will be served from 5.00pm.\n\n\n\n\n",

Although questions about consciousness have puzzled humanity for centuries, an empirical scientific research program, which aims to identify the neural correlates of consciousness, has started relatively recently, only a few decades ago. As such, we are still far from answering the fascinating questions about consciousness, such as: Can we tell unconscious people from conscious ones, just based on neural activity in the brain? Is each one of us consciously experiencing the world in the same way - Can we determine if my \u201cred\u201d color sensation is the same as yours, based on neural measures? Do newborn babies, animals, insects, plants and future artificial intelligence have consciousness? In this talk, I will discuss recent progress on scientific research on\u00a0 onsciousness, which paves possible ways to address these seemingly philosophical questions with empirical neuroscientific methods. In the future we may arrive at the theory of consciousness to answer these questions.</P>\n<P>Dr Tsuchiya was awarded a PhD at California Institute of Technology in 2006. In 2012, he joined the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University as an Associate Professor. His main research interest is to uncover the physical basis of consciousness. Specifically, he focuses on:\u00a0<BR>1) the scope and limit of non-conscious processing,\u00a0<BR>2) the relationship between attention and consciousness,\u00a0<BR>3) the neuronal correlates of consciousness and\u00a0<BR>4) testing a theory of consciousness, in particular, integrated information<BR>theory of consciousness. Combining empirical, computational and theoretical research methods through interdisciplinary collaborations, he hopes to solve to the problem of consciousness.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>Dr Jennifer M.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund.

This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS FIONA LEE\n\n\n\nFiona is a seasoned traveller \u2014 literally and metaphorically.\nAfter studying Environmental Science and Education, Fiona enthusiastically plunged into teaching teenagers, developing sustainable policy and practice in the government and non-government sectors. Burnt out by 33, she swapped her briefcase for a backpack. During five years of travel, Fiona studied mindfulness with many teachers and traditions around the world.\nOver 20 years, Fiona has developed her own unique approach as a therapist. She offers personal consultations, group and corporate training and retreats globally. Fiona also offers advanced practitioner training to other therapists.\u00a0\nTime alone in nature has always provided essential balance for Fiona and she chooses to live in a small town with a forest at the end of her street... (Yep, she was into forest bathing before it was a thing). As a single Mum, running her own business, Fiona is challenged to remain mindful every day. She maintains her sanity by taking micro vacations in her hammock.\nFiona is also fascinated by ancient cultures, human origins and the meaning of life. She researches, writes and presents about these things in her spare moments.\nFiona is deeply passionate, playful and practical. She loves empowering people with mindfulness and helping them to make the most of the adventure that is life. She recommends everyone buy a hammock.\nYou can learn more about Fiona at\u00a0www.fiona-lee.com\u00a0\u00a0or on Facebook; Of The Wings.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.

During five years of travel, Fiona studied mindfulness with many teachers and traditions around the world.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Over 20 years, Fiona has developed her own unique approach as a therapist.

(Yep, she was into forest bathing before it was a thing). As a single Mum, running her own business, Fiona is challenged to remain mindful every day. She maintains her sanity by taking micro vacations in her hammock.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Fiona is also fascinated by ancient cultures, human origins and the meaning of life. She researches, writes and presents about these things in her spare moments.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Fiona is deeply passionate, playful and practical.

We apologise for the inconvenience, the function room is upstairs & there is no lift.\n*Please note that there is NO SET BOOK for our Book Club! You may come & just listen, or talk about whatever you have recently been reading - no pressure, just books!*\nOur guest authors for Tuesday May 7th are:\nLeah Kaminsky - fiction, new book Hollow Bones\nLeah Kaminsky is a physician and award-winning writer. Her debut novel,\u00a0The Waiting Room, won the prestigious Voss Literary Prize. She conceived and edited\u00a0Writer MD, a collection of prominent physician-writers, which starred on Booklist and is co-author of\u00a0Cracking the Code, with the Damiani family. She holds an MFA in fiction from Vermont College of Fine Arts. (www.leahkaminsky.com).\nMeg Bignell - fiction, new book Sparkle Pages (A wonderfully original and heartfelt comic novel about one woman's mission to reignite the passion in her marriage - and rediscover herself.)\nMeg Bignell was a nurse and a weather presenter on the telly before she surrendered to a persistent desire to write. Since then she has been writing almost every day \u2013 bits and pieces here and there, either to earn a crust, to get something off her chest or to entertain herself. She has written three short films, mostly because she wanted to do some acting and no one else would cast her. She sings a bit too, occasionally writes and performs cabaret, but is mostly very busy being a mother to three and a wife (to one). She lives with her family on a dairy farm on Tasmania\u2019s East Coast.\nLisa Shulman\u00a0- photography book, Shopfront\nAward-winning photographer Lisa Shulman has launched her first book Shopfront, a collection of black and white photographs and stories taken from her exhibition Shopfront held at the Town Hall Gallery, Hawthorn in 2010.\nIn recent years Lisa has further explored the background of people behind Shopfront and her book creates a valuable historical account of selected businesses in Hawthorn. \"I wanted to capture the gracious character of local businesses in Hawthorn before our shared streetscape is totally transformed,\" says Lisa.\nThe book is edited by Jan Epstein. It is dedicated to maintaining the heritage of Hawthorn.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe will provide some finger foods and beverages/tea/coffee on the night, as well as some giveaways supplied by publishers. The cost for each evening will be $15.00 all inclusive.  Please join us by booking a ticket here.\nDoors open 6.30pm for a 6.45pm start. Dymocks Camberwell celebrated 2012 The National Year of Reading with the inauguration of our very own First Tuesday Book Club, each month. After our guest authors speak, we finish the evening by talking about our favourite novels, both new & older ones. We will ask participants to comment about books they have read or are reading, just like a normal book club. We won\u2019t be setting a monthly book, as we want to hear about as many books as possible, including old favourites. You may just want to listen at times and hear about other people\u2019s experiences with their books. It is totally up to you!",

                "text": "\u00a0 \u00a0 Are you looking to make some positive changes in you life? Interested in learning how to meditate and be more mindful? Or perhaps just wanting to bring your body, mind and soul back into balance and feel relaxed and calm?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Hi my name is Fiona Neason and I\u2019m a Mindfulness Meditation Teacher and a Reiki Master Practitioner. I am so passionate about what I do and I love that through my work I can help people in so many areas of their life. Past participants have said that they are able to handle situations better, they feel happier & healthier and the finally understand why people meditate. I\u2019ve also had someone who\u2019s headaches improved out of sight. So meditation can work in many levels of our lives. But the basic idea around it is: happy mind, happy body, happy life.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Over the 4 weeks I \u00a0will take you on a journey introducing all of the main concepts of Mindfulness Meditation. Each class will be two hours long and it will be a mixture of theory, meditations and group sharing.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I will be drawing from that knowledge of my teacher training and also bringing in my own style that I have learnt over the last 10 years. The course will be easy enough for beginners to learn and also beneficial for people who already have an existing meditation practise.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Groups sizes are kept small, in order for participants to feel comfortable and to maximise learning. You will also be given journal so you can record what you felt in your meditations. We will learn the best breathing technique, learn the origins of mindfulness, and learn how to integrate mindfulness & meditation into our daily lives.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Each class that we have is extremely powerful and will lead into the following week, so participants must be available to attend all 4 classes. I will also send you weekly emails, so that you remain focused and are able to pick up extra tips and tricks. I will also be sending you through downloadable meditations, so that you can practise your skills outside of class and beyond. The core reason for this course is for you to be able to integrate mindfulness into your everyday lives, which you will learn just isn\u2019t through meditation.\nSo what exactly will you receive?!\n\n\n4 x 2 hours jam packed sessions\n\n\n8 downloadable meditations for you to keep and have to do whenever you like\n\n\nA journal to write down your experience within the class\n\n\nWeekly emails to give you inspiration and prompts to keep you on track.\n\n\nA small, supportive, safe and fun space to meditate in with other awesome participants\n\n\nYummy and healthy snacks and organic teas\n\n\nAn opportunity to change your life and bring in more joy and happiness\n\n\nThe exchange\n\u00a0 \u00a0 There is an early bird special if you get in quick for only $133. After the early bird, prices will go up to $155. Early bird will go until the 24th of April.\nThe venue and time\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The course will be ran from the Healesville Yoga studio on a Tuesday night from 6:30 pm until 8:30pm, starting the first week of May - 6th, 13th, 20th & 27th.\nHow to get there\n\u00a0 \u00a0 We are located at 38 Don Road Healesville. As you drive in the wire fence, you will drive all the way to the end (past The Healesville Wellness Factory) and then turn right. You will see a sign for the Healesville Yoga studio and that\u2019s where you will find us.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 If you do have any questions or queries, please feel free to send me an email: ajourneywithin@outlook.com or please call me mobile on 0439 411 608.\nI look forward to working with you.\nAll the best Fiona\n",

                "text": "\nOn Tuesday 7 May, Melbourne chef, owner of the award winning restaurant Annam, and the immensely popular Pho Nom restaurants, and now\u00a0 author, Jerry Mai will be joining us for the Melbourne launch of her new book: Street Food Vietnam.\nStreet Food Vietnam is Jerry's homage to the food of her community, family and childhood.\u00a0 As a chef, Jerry has had many influences working in illustrious kitchens including Dandelion, Ezard, Gingerboy, Seamstress, and David Thompson's Nahm but it is her family heritage and the food of her Vietnamese childhood that is perhaps her biggest influence.\nThis is a wonderfully authentic book, from a chef at the top of her game cooking the Vietnamese food that Melbourne loves.\u00a0 \nPlease join us for\u00a0 some wonderful tastes, a cold beer, and\u00a0 an intimate chat with Jerry Mai\nAbout Jerry (in her words!)\nI was born in Vietnam in the late 1970s, but in 1984 my family moved to Australia and I didn\u2019t return to the country of my birth until 1992. I was 15 at the time, and the trip was completely overwhelming: the incredible smells, flavours, people and, of course, the crazy traffic!\nIt was my first introduction to Vietnamese street food, and I was immediately hooked. The streets were filled with food vendors selling endless dishes, some of which I\u2019d never seen before. The smell of the smoke and meat cooking on those little charcoal grills lured me to the stalls and had me eagerly watching what was being cooked up.\u00a0 The streets may have changed and modernised over the last 25 years, but many of the local street-food dishes have stood the test of time (along with a few flash-in-the-pans that have come and gone). Every year I visit different regions of Vietnam to try new food experiences, and I am never disappointed. As a chef, I find myself reinvigorated after each visit and inspired to recreate the flavours I discover on my journeys in new and unique ways.\n\nAbout the Book (again in Jerry's words)\nThis book is the culmination of my long love affair with Vietnamese food. It encapsulates the dishes that I dream of when I\u2019m not in Vietnam, along with the food I love to make in my restaurants. Vietnamese food is the heart and soul of what I cook, and it\u2019s a big part of what I love about my heritage.\u00a0 Some of the recipes in this book are dishes I grew up eating at home. As a child, I would stand on a stool in the kitchen and watch my mum slave over the stove, whipping up amazing food for our family and friends to enjoy. If banh xeo was for dinner,the house would be filled with the smell of fresh herbs and the sound of sizzling as the batter hit the hot wok. Banh xeo night at home was like playing musical chairs, as each person took turns to make the next pancake. I loved the hands-on nature of the dish and the challenge between me and my brothers to see who would make the best banh xeo!\nPlease join us for what will be a wonderfully warm and rewarding evening.\u00a0 As always, we'll be tasting a few recipes as well as chatting to Jerry over a Vietnamese beer or two.\n\nFAQs\nCan I buy/pre-order signed copies of Street Food Vietnam?\nYes - copies will be available for signing and purchase on the night - $35.\u00a0 If you can't attend we can organise to post signed copies to you.\u00a0 Postage (tracked & insured): Victoria $7.95; Australia wide $9.95; overseas we'll quote.\nI've already purchased the book - can I bring it to be signed?Well...to be honest...we'd rather you didn't...we do these events to sell books.\u00a0We subsidise our events by the sale of books on the night. We would prefer not to have to increase our event fee.
