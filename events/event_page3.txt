Dr Nisbet\u2019s research deals with the fabrication of synthetic cellular microenvironments that support stem cell survival, adhesion and promote differentiation. Currently he has been investigating the feasibility of using biodegradable self assembling peptide hydrogels to control stem cell behaviour both in vitro an in vivo. His approach is to attempt to fabricate a synthetic niche microenvironment for endogenous and/or grafted stem cells, whilst optimizing the interfacial features to provide both structural and biochemical support.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDr Nisbet has researched at Monash University, Melbourne University (Florey Neuroscience Institute), the University of Toronto and the University of California Berkeley and subsequently established a research group at the ANU that bridges the School of Engineering and the John Curtain School of Medical Research (JCSMR).\u00a0 His academic contributions have been recognized by the national and international scientific community through award of: Kenneth Hunt Medal for best Engineering thesis, and the Mollie Holman Medal for best PhD thesis across the entire university (Monash); (2011) Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship to work at the University of California, Berkeley; and (2011) Bethlehem Griffith Research Foundation young medical researcher of the year. \r\n\u00a0\r\nDr Nisbet has graduated 11 PhD students, 7 who are postdoctoral fellows, and 4 who work in industry.
