                "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous condition that affects about 26,500 Australians. It has a strong autoimmune component leading to the body\u2019s own defence system to attack the central nervous system. This can result in impairments in limb functioning, vision and cognition, and lead to fatigue, low mood, pain, disability, reduced quality of life and ultimately, early death. Despite an intensive international research focus on MS, the specific causes of MS are unknown, however MS is likely due to a combination of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. This public lecture will address the current research findings covering different aspects of MS from basic research, clinical interventions and perspective of people living with this condition. \n\nProfessor David Tscharke, Head of Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at The John Curtin School of Medical Research\nDr Anne Br\u00fcstle, fellow and group leader Immunology and Infectious Diseases at The John Curtin School of Medical Research\nDr Jo Lane, clinical psychologist and research fellow at the Research School of Population Health \nAmy Lynn, Multiple Sclerosis Ambassador for the ACT\n",
                "html": "<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous condition that affects about 26,500 Australians. It has a strong autoimmune component leading to the body\u2019s own defence system to attack the central nervous system. This can result in impairments in limb functioning, vision and cognition, and lead to fatigue, low mood, pain, disability, reduced quality of life and ultimately, early death. Despite an intensive international research focus on MS, the specific <I>causes</I> of MS are unknown, however MS is likely due to a combination of genetic, immunological and environmental factors.

And we expanded our work to Queensland and the Latrobe Valley, places that have been key to the national conversation around climate change.\n2019 is shaping up to be a critical year. After a record-breaking summer of floods, fires and droughts, the climate movement has rapidly gained momentum. And with a federal election on the horizon, we have a clear opportunity to demand government action.\nBut we have seen momentum before and we have seen it wane.\nFor momentum to have lasting impact, we need to harness it and lock it down into deep, lasting commitment. We know conversation can transform surface concern into this deep commitment. As the only organisation in Australia dedicated to peer-to-peer conversations on climate change, our work is needed now more than ever.\nBut we need your support. Everything we have achieved to date has been realised through the generosity of thousands of people, whose donations and time have propelled our work forward. \n\n\n\nThis event will kick off our annual crowdfunder. Last year we beat our target and raised over $165,000. This year, we're aiming for at least $180,000. It's a huge goal, but if we launch well we are confident we can achieve it.\nSo come to celebrate all we have achieved in such a short time and help us launch our biggest ever crowdfunding campaign with a bang!\nPlaces are limited and will fill quickly, so reserve a free ticket now so as not to miss out.\nAll donations on the night will be greatly appreciated.
