                "text": "Our runaway emotions can and do influence the way we react in the workplace on a daily basis. Having a higher level of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) means having the ability to recognise your behaviours, moods and impulses and manage them in a positive way. \u00a0So instead of over-reacting and over-compensating when things don't go as planned, you are much better equipped to understand the effects your emotions are having on you at any given moment.\r\nIn this PD Training course, you'll learn skills like how to interpret and manage your emotions and balance your optimism and pessimism, using coping methods and relaxation techniques, managing your non-verbal communication and more. This course will make you more aware of your own thoughts and feelings and as a result it will improve your ability to interact calmly with others both in the workplace and at home.\r\nThis newly found emotional \"awareness\" allows you to communicate more effectively, succeed at work and achieve your career and personal goals in a shorter amount of time.\r\nThis dynamic training course is available now throughout Australia, including Brisbane, Sydney, Parramatta, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth. \u00a0Click on the\u00a0public course registration buttons\u00a0to choose your course or for courses delivered at your location click to\u00a0get a free quote.\r\nLearning Outcomes\r\nAfter completing this course participants will have learned how to:\r\nKnow how to read emotions\u00a0Understand your own level of emotional intelligence\u00a0Use the Johari window to understand what you reveal to others about yourself and what others reveal to you\u00a0Understand resilience and how to build it\u00a0Understand social awareness and empathy and how to be more empathic and socially aware\u00a0Understand how different cultures respond to and display emotions\u00a0Know how to influence others positively\u00a0Know how to have emotionally intelligent conversations\u00a0Understand manipulation and emotional dishonesty and how to avoid it\u00a0Understand how to lead with emotional intelligence\r\n\u00a0\r\nCourse Outline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 1\u00a0EQ - A Passing Fad?\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Power of Emotions\r\nThe Limbic System\r\nUseful Models of Emotional Intelligence\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 2\u00a0I Feel\u00a0therefore\u00a0I Am\u00a0\r\n\r\nTuning in to your own emotions\r\nJohari Window\r\nSelf-Control\r\nResilience\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 3\u00a0The Emotions of Others\u00a0\r\n\r\nInterpersonal skills\r\nSocial Awareness and Empathy\r\nEmotions and Culture\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 4\u00a0Emotions @ Work\u00a0\r\n\r\nInfluencing Others\r\nHaving difficult conversations\r\nDealing with change\r\nToxic Workplaces and Emotional Intelligence\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 5\u00a0The Dark\u00a0side\u00a0\r\n\r\nManipulation\r\nEmotional Honesty\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 6\u00a0Leading and Emotions\u00a0\r\n\r\nLeadership and Emotional Intelligence\r\nEmotional Agility\r\nCultivating EI in\u00a0organisations\r\nReflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) Training Course - Lesson 7\u00a0Reflections\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreate an Action Plan\r\nAccountability = Action\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You will master how to test software for common vulnerabilities via dynamic analysis and measure their impact.\n\nSyllabus\n1. Hello world\nLike a hello-world program, in the first chapter you will go through end-to-end process of identifying, measuring, reporting and patching a security vulnerability\n2. Know where to start\nIdentify low hanging fruit, learn novel techniques to uncover sensitive meta-data and map an attack surface of a program\n3. Create a hacker mindset\nUnderstand the fundamental mindset behind hacking and learn how to identify threats for a software feature during the design phase\n4. Identify and exploit security defects\nLearn how to identify a vulnerability and measure its impact. Explore common security vulnerabilities on Web Applications. Web is a familiar environment, hence a great technology to start. The approach taught in this chapter can be applied to other technologies. We cover OWASP and go beyond. Security vulnerabilities in the following software components are explored:\n\nSession management\nOutput rendering\nUser interface\nURL and file handling\nBusiness logic\nSecond order bugs\n\n5. Hacking contest (CTF)\nAt the end of the course, everything is put into practice via a fun hacking game\n\nStudent Testimonials\n\u201cHaving most of the testers in one group was great as we helped each other keep up. There is a good balance between theory and practical activities. Having the current real world examples in the presentation slides. Love the setup of Hacking Contest.
