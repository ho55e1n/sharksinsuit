                "text": "This is a must attend seminar aimed at Oracle professionals (both DBAs and Developers) who are interested in Performance Tuning.\u00a0 The seminar will detail how to maximise the performance of both Oracle databases and associated applications and how to diagnose and address any performance issues as quickly and effectively as possible.\nWhen an application suddenly runs \u201cslow\u201d or when people start complaining about the \u201cpoor performance\u201d of the database, there\u2019s often some uncertainty in how to most quickly and most accurately determine the \u201croot\u201d cause of any such slowdown and effectively address any associated issues. In this seminar, we explore a Tuning Methodology that helps Oracle professionals to both quickly and reliably determine the actual causes of performance issues and so ensure the effectiveness of any applied resolutions.\nLooking at a number of real world scenarios and numerous actual examples and test cases, this seminar will show participants how to confidently and reliably diagnose performance issues. The seminar explores in much detail the various diagnostics tools and reports available in Oracle to assist in determining any database performance issue and importantly WHEN and HOW to effectively use each approach.\u00a0Additionally, participants are also invited to share their own database/SQL reports where we can apply the principles learnt in diagnosing the performance of their actual databases/applications\u00a0(we can communicate prior to the event on how to best get any reports of interest).\nOne of the more common reasons for poor Oracle performance is inefficient or poorly running SQL. This seminar explores in much detail how SQL is executed within the Oracle database, the various issues and related concepts important in understanding why SQL might be inefficient and the many capabilities and features Oracle has in helping to both resolve SQL performance issues and to maintain the stability and reliability of SQL execution.\nIt\u2019s a fun, but intense, content rich seminar that is suitable for people of all experiences (from beginners to seasoned Oracle experts).\n\nNote: Numbers are strictly limited due to the small class nature of the seminars. Please book early to avoid disappointment as seminars are not scheduled regularly.\n\nAll seminars include:\n\n\nDetailed course notes\n\n\nTea/Coffee\n\n\nLunch\n\n\n\u00a0\nSeminar Content (subject to minor change)\nSection One: Basic Tuning Concepts\n\n\nCommon (but flawed) Tuning Methodology\n\n\nTHE Correct Tuning Methodology\n\n\nImportance of Response Times\n\n\nImportance of Database Time and Concurrent Active Sessions\n\n\nIntroduction to Oracle Wait Interface\n\n\nThe Correct Mentality To Performance Tuning\n\n\nImportance Of Instrumentation\n\n\n\u00a0\nSection Two: Database Tuning\nIn Section Two, we explore how to best diagnose any performance issues as quickly as possible to accurately determine any root issue(s) and so apply the most appropriate resolutions. We explore a number of real world examples as well as providing the opportunity to go through any reports participants may wish to share.\nAs part of determining how to best resolve a number of real world examples, we get the opportunity to explore the internals of the database and the importance of understanding a number of crucial Oracle database concepts (e.g. latch contention, redo log mechanism, RAC cache fusion).\nBecause of the abundance of Oracle database instrumentation and the wealth of data available in (say) AWR Reports, many Oracle professionals feel swamped and are uncertain how to correctly read these types of reports when trying to diagnose a performance issue. In this section, we look at both WHEN and HOW to read the various reports to very quickly and reliably determine any performance issues and so know with certainty how to apply the most appropriate solution.\nWe explore the following Oracle supplied database diagnostics methods and when each of them are most appropriate to determine and resolve performance issues using a methodical tuning methodology:\n\n\nStatspack Reports\n\n\nAutomatic Workload Repository (AWR) Reports\n\n\nAutomatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) Reports\n\n\nActive Session History (ASH) Reports\n\n\n(Advanced) SQL Trace Files\n\n\n\u00a0\nSection Three: SQL Tuning\nOne of the most common reasons for poor performance is related to poorly running, inefficient SQL statements. In this section we explore in detail a number of important concepts and Oracle capabilities (up to and including Oracle Database 18c) in relation to maximising the performance and stability of SQL statements. Attendees will learn not only how to effectively tune SQL statements, but how to do so in a consistent manner to maximise both SQL performance and stability, by understanding how to determine the root cause of performance issues and hence implement the most appropriate solution to resolve any issues.\nTopics covered include:\n\n\nCBO Internals And How The CBO Costs SQL Statements\n\n\nWhy Is The More \u201cExpensive\u201d Costed SQL Often The Faster\n\n\nDifferences between ALL_ROWS and FIRST_ROWS(n) optimization\n\n\nSetting Optimizer Based Parameters\n\n\nCPU Cost Model and System Statistics\n\n\nSchema Statistics Gathering Tips\n\n\nHistogram Internals\n\n\nExtended Statistics and Virtual Columns\n\n\nDynamic Sampling\n\n\nDisplaying and Reading Execution Plans\n\n\nGATHER_PLAN_STATISTICS Hint\n\n\nManaging Outlier Data\n\n\nJoin Processing, Join Types and Join Methods\n\n\nAdaptive Query Optimization\n\n\nAdaptive Plans\n\n\nCardinality Feedback\n\n\nAdaptive Statistics\n\n\nSQL Plan Directives\n\n\nSQL Blocks\n\n\nSQL Transformations\n\n\n10053 Trace Report\n\n\nSQL Monitor Reports\n\n\nSQL Hints (and when/how to use appropriately)\n\n\nSQL Patching\n\n\nSQL Plan Stability\n\n\nSQL Profiles\n\n\nSQL Stored Outlines\n\n\nMigrating Stored Outlines to SQL Plan Management (Baselines)\n\n\nSQL Plan Management (Baselines)\n\n\nBaselines Use Cases\n\n\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nPlease email richard@richardfooteconsulting.com with any questions.\n\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nThere are no refunds if seminar proceeds. If unable to attend, attendees may either transfer ticket to another employee (notification required) or attend a subsequent seminar. If seminar is canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, a full refund will be issued.\n\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nKeep your ticket handy either in the Eventbrite App or print it out and bring with you.\n\u00a0\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?\nYes. Please notify richard@richardfooteconsulting.com if you are transfering your attendance to another person.\n\u00a0\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?\nYes.

In this section, we look at both WHEN and HOW to read the various reports to very quickly and reliably determine any performance issues and so know with certainty how to apply the most appropriate solution.</P>\n<P>We explore the following Oracle supplied database diagnostics methods and when each of them are most appropriate to determine and resolve performance issues using a methodical tuning methodology:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Statspack Reports</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) Reports</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) Reports</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Active Session History (ASH) Reports</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>(Advanced) SQL Trace Files</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>Section Three: SQL Tuning</STRONG></P>\n<P>One of the most common reasons for poor performance is related to poorly running, inefficient SQL statements. In this section we explore in detail a number of important concepts and Oracle capabilities (up to and including Oracle Database 18c) in relation to maximising the performance and stability of SQL statements. Attendees will learn not only how to effectively tune SQL statements, but how to do so in a consistent manner to maximise both SQL performance and stability, by understanding how to determine the root cause of performance issues and hence implement the most appropriate solution to resolve any issues.</P>\n<P>Topics covered include:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>CBO Internals And How The CBO Costs SQL Statements</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Why Is The More \u201cExpensive\u201d Costed SQL Often The Faster</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Differences between ALL_ROWS and FIRST_ROWS(n) optimization</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Setting Optimizer Based Parameters</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>CPU Cost Model and System Statistics</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Schema Statistics Gathering Tips</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Histogram Internals</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Extended Statistics and Virtual Columns</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Dynamic Sampling</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Displaying and Reading Execution Plans</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>GATHER_PLAN_STATISTICS Hint</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Managing Outlier Data</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Join Processing, Join Types and Join Methods</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Adaptive Query Optimization</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Adaptive Plans</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Cardinality Feedback</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Adaptive Statistics</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Plan Directives</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Blocks</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Transformations</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>10053 Trace Report</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Monitor Reports</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Hints (and when/how to use appropriately)</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Patching</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Plan Stability</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Profiles</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Stored Outlines</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Migrating Stored Outlines to SQL Plan Management (Baselines)</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>SQL Plan Management (Baselines)</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Baselines Use Cases</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>How can I contact the organiser with any questions?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Please email richard@richardfooteconsulting.com with any questions.</P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>What's the refund policy?</STRONG></P>\n<P>There are no refunds if seminar proceeds.

                "text": "This is a two-day workshop on using game design (and play) to tackle organisation and community challenges.\r\nThis workshop is very hands-on \u2013 a combination of playing different types of games and discussing with peers how to adapt them to different challenges. You will walk away with new activities, resources and a summary of all the games in the workshop.\r\nIn a world that won't stand still and where conventional approaches are not enough, games are one interactive zone where there have been fresh creative approaches. We believe there is a lot to be learned from this new wave of games which:\r\n- open up new routes to\u00a0experience rather than just talk about complexity- people collaborate in new ways- democratises futures\r\nWe also have a set of applied games inspired by these which have been developed by futurists, climate change scientists, and community workers who show how these approaches can be used by organisations and in the community.\r\n\u201cGames are about developing empathy, generating systems thinking, and helping us figure out the future.\u201d\u00a0Colleen Macklin, associate professor of Design and Technology at Parsons School of Design and maker of Metagame, a card game designed to spark fresh discussion on pressing social issues.\r\nWho should attend?\r\nAnyone grappling with complex and difficult issues, whether that be in day-to-day work, when preparing a presentation or conference workshop, when inviting ideas from others, and when comparing options.\u00a0You might be involved in facilitating workshops, or offering training, doing community engagement activities, teaching, lecturing, creating policy or working in a team.\r\nWhat do you cover?\r\nGame framework:\u00a0We give you an academic framework developed by a game designer. We think it works even better for facilitators.\r\nGame components:\u00a0We take the best and most relevant new games for facilitators. You play and break down how they work.\r\nGame experience:\u00a0You will experience a lot of different games, helping you understand what works and why.\r\nApplied games:\u00a0The best games designed by futurists, climate change activists and an award winning participatory game Viv helped design.\r\nGame variations:\u00a0How to adapt games for the contexts in which you work. We give you the skills and tips on how to tweak games.\r\nWhat can we learn from games?\r\nResearch from the fields of creativity, innovation and strategy tells us to evolve our practice we need to continue to be inspired and learn from other fields. We believe we can learn how to bring even the most difficult topics alive, develop a shared language for complex issues, and learn how to tap the aliveness just under the surface.\r\nGames have always been used to tackle the most challenging issues alive in a society, whether it\u2019s ethics or unaffordable housing. Games are increasingly used in futures work because they are visceral, interactive and they enable people to work with complex systems. While boardgames can be loaded with information, game designers look to make it as easy as possible for their players to get started.\r\nThe shift to cross-functional, creative collaboration requires new skills and practices. Games are a space where groups can work better together in a different way than they have learned to do in typical meetings.\r\n\u201cWe need to produce people who know how to act when they are faced with situations for which they were not specifically prepared.\u201dSeymour Papert\r\n\u00a0\r\nYour hosts - we play well together!\r\nViv McWaters, Australia: I once wanted to be an astronomical photographer but settled for agricultural journalist, which caused quite a hoo-ha as women weren\u2019t supposed to go to agricultural college.

I\u2019ve worked as a journalist, and in communications, and community education, training and strategy development. Now I specialise in facilitation and draw on my background in the natural sciences and arts. Improvisation is a constant source of inspiration, as is nature, play and the surprising things that people say and do. I have worked in over 35 different countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, which has helped fuel my passion for bird watching and street art.\r\nLee Ryan, New Zealand: I was in a small hall by the seaside doing improv for the first time in a decade with 12 other people when I realized that where you really build your muscles for innovation is in improvisation. At the time I was leading an innovation practice across 33 countries for a multinational organization but so much of our training was grounded in a process. Now I work as a Design Coach with teams across New Zealand, Australia, Jakarta and China; teach business executives at our largest university and every now and then help to host industry conferences. I continue to be fascinated by the power of games, Lego and the quality of conversation accompanied by a NZ Pinot.\r\nThe Small Print\r\nGST of 10% is added to your registration fee.\r\nCost includes refreshments and lunch on both days.\r\nWe understand that sometimes plans change.

Our classes aim to provide expectant parents with the knowledge and confidence to successfully breastfeed.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe.

                "text": "The Edge Leadership Course\nPractical Leadership for Team Leaders or Supervisors.\u00a0SIRF Rt members in Victoria and Tasmania may be eligible for free attendance to this course. Contact Brian Niven or Alain Le Bon for details.\n\nThe Edge Leadership Program has a unique delivery schedule, with 6 one-day sessions spread out over a few months, each hosted at a different site with a presentation by one of the host organisation's senior leaders and a site tour. Participants not only learn from the course content and homework, but from the peer-to-peer interaction with others from different positions in different companies attending the course.\n\nFocusing on the \"soft\" skills of leadership, the course covers a wide array of topics, all building the participants' skills in leadership (not management). The course is dynamic, with videos, exercises, homework, group discussions, and personal reflection. The course outcomes include:\n\nImproved leadership skills and strategies as measured by before and after 360 degree feedback scores from both team members and direct manager.\nExposure to presentations from site leaders concerning their leadership successes and failures.\nMentor relationship established within your business with a mentor for each trainee.\nPractical exercises that involves participant\u2019s team to ensure training is transferred back to site.\nPeer to peer learning from other supervisors on the course coming from a diversity of backgrounds.\nStructure /planning and time management.\nGiving and receiving feedback\nIdentifying and having critical conversations to boost team performance\n\nParticipating companies may be asked to host one day of the training, which includes providing a meeting space, lunch, and morning and afternoon tea.\nWe have successfully completed dozens of programs and it has proven to be very popular within the SIRF member group. Our target audience is supervisors and team leaders who have never had any previous leadership experience, but have also trained future leaders and even a manager or two with great success.\n\nTestimonials\n\"I found the course provided a great opportunity to network with people from other organisations who are in a similar position to myself. Visiting sites around Victoria and seeing how people and products are managed in different industries was a rewarding way to learn new aspects of leadership. During the course I was able to narrow my focus, in regards to the direction I want to take within the company, and believe I have the ability (as well as the drive) to move into a Production Management role.\"\nShayne, Team Leader\n\"Over the years I have done many leadership courses and I have gotten tired of them. So when I heard I had to do another one I was very cynical. But from the beginning it became clear to me that this course was different. Not only were the teachers great but the topics covered were very interesting and relevant. One of my goals with this course was to reenergise myself as a team leader.

Participants not only learn from the course content and homework, but from the peer-to-peer interaction with others from different positions in different companies attending the course.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Focusing on the \"soft\" skills of leadership, the course covers a wide array of topics, all building the participants' skills in leadership (not management). The course is dynamic, with videos, exercises, homework, group discussions, and personal reflection. The course outcomes include:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Improved leadership skills and strategies as measured by before and after 360 degree feedback scores from both team members and direct manager.</LI>\n<LI>Exposure to presentations from site leaders concerning their leadership successes and failures.</LI>\n<LI>Mentor relationship established within your business with a mentor for each trainee.</LI>\n<LI>Practical exercises that involves participant\u2019s team to ensure training is transferred back to site.</LI>\n<LI>Peer to peer learning from other supervisors on the course coming from a diversity of backgrounds.</LI>\n<LI>Structure /planning and time management.</LI>\n<LI>Giving and receiving feedback</LI>\n<LI>Identifying and having critical conversations to boost team performance</LI>\n</UL>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Participating companies may be asked to host one day of the training, which includes providing a meeting space, lunch, and morning and afternoon tea.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>We have successfully completed dozens of programs and it has proven to be very popular within the SIRF member group.

Visiting sites around Victoria and seeing how people and products are managed in different industries was a rewarding way to learn new aspects of leadership. During the course I was able to narrow my focus, in regards to the direction I want to take within the company, and believe I have the ability (as well as the drive) to move into a Production Management role.\"</SPAN></I></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Shayne, Team Leader</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><I><SPAN>\"Over the years I have done many leadership courses and I have gotten tired of them. So when I heard I had to do another one I was very cynical. But from the beginning it became clear to me that this course was different. Not only were the teachers great but the topics covered were very interesting and relevant. One of my goals with this course was to reenergise myself as a team leader. And SIRF helped me achieve this. I now have a different approach to my work and all people in my organisation have noticed a positive change.

                "text": "The Talk:\nThis talk is part of the 'Building Accessibility' series and discusses the need to provide an inclusive approach to building design and evacuation planning, to meet the needs of all occupants.\nAustralian society is changing, we are living longer, extending our working lives and increasingly making our homes in taller buildings. Additionally, in 2011 building and disability legislation changed to make it mandatory to provide fully accessible workplaces and public spaces. However, the need to get everybody out in an emergency has generally been overlooked. This presentation argues a case to develop the concept of\u00a0egressability\u00a0to go hand in hand with accessibility.\nThis session is limited to 18 people only. Please note, this is not an online talk or webinar. It is being held in Scoresby, Victoria, Australia.\nThe Presenter:\nPresented by Lee Wilson, a disability access and egress consultant in Melbourne.\u00a0In early 2018 he was appointed\u00a0as a volunteer Subject Matter Expert (Disability Access) by\u00a0the Australian Building Codes Board.\u00a0\n\nLee has been actively campaigning for a universal design approach to egress for several years and published numerous articles, a guidebook and a white paper on these issues.\u00a0\nLee released a free 189-page guidebook\u00a0'Evacuation of People with Disability & Emergent Limitations: Considerations for Safer Buildings & Efficient Evacuations, 2nd Edition'\u00a0released in 2016. You can read more about the guidebook and download it from this\u00a0link.\n\nSeminar Timings:\n09:00 am to 09:15 am - Arrivals, networking, introductions\n09:15 am to 10:15 am - The presentation\n10:15 am to 10:30 am - Question time\nSeminar Content:\nTopics will include:\n\nThe concept of 'Universal Design' and 'EgressAbility'\nEmergency planning and evacuation strategies\nThe 'gap' in legislation\nEmerging risk factors\nAustralian requirements and Overseas requirements\nCurrent building code requirements\u00a0\nOccupant warning concepts\nEnhanced measures for safe evacuation\nAccessible wayfinding strategies\nFire engineered solutions and performance-based building codes\nPersonal & group evacuation plan templates\nDesigns for refuge areas\n\nThere is an onsite cafe for those needing a coffee or breakfast before the presentation.\nFAQs:\nWho should attend?\nThis talk is suitable for people of all backgrounds and professions. It is designed as an entry-level introduction to the concept of universal design and the \"what, where, when, who\" of evacuation planning for people of varying abilities, ages and sizes. Suitable for workplace managers, employers, fire engineers, access consultants, building surveyors, team leaders or anyone concerned about how they might be evacuated in an emergency.\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nThe building is conveniently located off the Eastlink (take the BP Service Centre exit).\nThere are external car parking areas to the east of the building (off Lakeview Drive) and to the west (in front of the adjoining buildings, 35 and 37 Dalmore Drive). The best accessible car parking spaces are located in front of\u00a035 and 37 Dalmore Drive. There are no undercover accessible car parking spaces.\nIf you are coming from the city via public transport, take the train to Glen Waverley, then catch the 753 bus to\u00a0Nyadale\u00a0Drive (and then it is a 2km walk to the office building though).\nIs the building wheelchair accessible?\nYes, it is a newly constructed office building with all accessible entrances, passenger lift, left-hand and right-hand configuration accessible toilets. However, avoid the eastern external car parking area if you have any difficulties using a stair (as above, use the car park\u00a0in front of\u00a035 and 37 Dalmore Drive).\nWhere is the training room located?\nThe training room is on the ground floor of the Waterman Business Centre.\u00a0The room is called The Laneway Boardroom. The photo below is the view as you arrive at the ground floor lobby area. If you walk down past the reception area, the training room is at the end of the internal laneway. See you there.\n\n\nDoes the room have hearing augmentation provided?\nNo, but if you would like us to organise a portable hearing loop system please let us know as we can organise this for you.\nWill any videos be open captioned?\nYes, they will.\u00a0\n If you have any additional accessibility needs please contact our office.\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nSorry, strictly no refunds.",

Many of our attendees have had positives meetings as a result of coming to Connect and partnerships have developed as a result. Not only can you meet a new person or business but you often find out something new about the people you already know because you stopped to talk about your business and focus on it for an hour. Regularly people have come to Jindabyne Connect and come away with a business opportunity.\n\n\u00a0\nSecondly the pitches are designed to be a way for a business to highlight themselves through asking for help from the community, bringing an opportunity or challenge to the community, a need for partnership or new challenge from an experience that the business has had. It is not about pure business promotion but a good pitch and a good idea will promote you and your business.\n\n\u00a0\nThirdly we try to include a speaker from Council, NSW Government, or Federal Government or other government bodies such as BEC or RDASI each month. This gives you the opportunity to interact with these representatives, ask questions and get information on what they are doing for the business community. That may be a business evaluation program, a council development, upcoming strategy in town, a grant that is available for applications or a new business program.\n\n\u00a0\nFinally, you get what you put in, so if you turn up with business cards, ready to engage, ask questions and see what you can find out, you might find a partner or new customer \u2013 that\u2019s a good outcome for an hour of your time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Speaking & SponsorshipWe average an attendance of 30-35 each month, and are growing, so come along and talk about your business. \n\n\nConnect events are available for sponsorship by a local business to provide more exposure to the audience, and to help cover the costs of drinks and nibbles. \n\n\u00a0\nIf you would like to speak or sponsor this event please contact Duncan Isaksen-Loxton 0416 325 673 to book in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0About\nJindabyne Connect is an initiative of the Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce, Snowy Monaro Regional Council and Ausindustry with the goal of developing, growing and supporting our business community.\n\u00a0\n",
