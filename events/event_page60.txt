Within the HR and Change profession we are often at the forefront of supporting our workforce to develop these new skills. But what about you? In this upcoming Supernova we are taking stock of our own race, looking and reflecting on the skills required within the OD, Change and Learning space to support our own growth and development. This practical and hands on Supernova will look at how we can prepare ourselves within the HR and Change professions to make this transition successful.</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Come listen, and share your thoughts on what is important to you, and your organisation.
