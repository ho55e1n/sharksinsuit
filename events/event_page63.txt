In this class we will dial in on how to use Python to work smarter and not harder. This class might also be useful for researchers who already know R and or Matlab pretty well, but would like to expose themselves to the syntax of python (spoiler, there will be lots of tabs!)We do this by looking deeper into \u201citeration\u201d which is just programmer talk for loops, but look at a variety of ways to repeat blocks of code and work through dataWe will also write our own functions, so we can easily repeat a set of instructions anywhere in a python scriptWe will learn how to read and write filesAnd lastly we will look at ways to handle potential errors occuring in our scriptsNote: This is not an introductory python tutorial, if you have never programmed before, you will likely get lost, so please consider attending an introductory class first",

In this class we will dial in on how to use Python to work smarter and not harder. This class might also be useful for researchers who already know R and or Matlab pretty well, but would like to expose themselves to the syntax of python (spoiler, there will be lots of tabs!)<BR><BR>We do this by looking deeper into \u201citeration\u201d which is just programmer talk for loops, but look at a variety of ways to repeat blocks of code and work through data<BR>We will also write our own functions, so we can easily repeat a set of instructions anywhere in a python script<BR>We will learn how to read and write files<BR>And lastly we will look at ways to handle potential errors occuring in our scripts<BR><BR><STRONG>Note: This is not an introductory python tutorial, if you have never programmed before, you will likely get lost, so please consider attending an introductory class first</STRONG></SPAN><BR></P>"

The\u00a0CSIRO History Project\u00a0(CHP) is being conducted by Swinburne University of Technology with financial and other support from CSIRO.A vital component of the CHP is the creation of an oral history collection for enduring archival preservation to support professional historical research, with edited versions being made available for general public access. The ongoing project captures individuals\u2019 experiences in their personal and professional lives and reflects upon their relationship with CSIRO.The first series of interviews,\u00a0comprising about 50 recorded hours, will become publicly accessible at the launch. An accompanying paper in\u00a0Historical Records of Australian Science\u00a0will go online simultaneously.\nThe evening will include presentations by:\nProfessor Tom Spurling\u00a0(CSIRO History Project leader);Professor Ian Rae\u00a0(Editor,\u00a0Historical Records of Australian Science); andAssociate Professor Gavan McCarthy\u00a0(Director,\u00a0eScholarship Research Centre)\nJoin us for this special event followed by networking drinks at\u00a0Swinburne University of Technology.\n\n\nAcknowledgement & Understanding\nBy registering to this event, you acknowledge and give consent that your email address will be added to the CTI database.
