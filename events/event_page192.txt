Relevant for writers of all genres, discover the secrets of creating vivid settings that ground your characters and captivate readers.\nAbout the expert:\nIsobelle began the first of her highly acclaimed Obernewtyn Chronicles while she was still at high school and worked on it while completing a Bachelor of Arts and then a journalism cadetship. The first book was accepted by the first publisher she sent it to and went on to be short-listed in the Older Readers section of the Children\u2019s Book Council Book of the Year Award for older readers. The series and her short stories have established her at the forefront of fantasy writing in Australia.\nShe has written many award winning short stories and books for young people since then. Scatterlings won Talking Book of the year in 1992 and in 1993 The Gathering was a joint winner of 1993 CBC Book of the Year Award and winner of the 1994 Children\u2019s Literature Peace Prize. Billy Thunder and the Night Gate was shortlisted for the Patricia Wrightson Prize for Childrens Literature in the 2001 NSW Premiers Literary Awards. Greylands was named a White Raven at Bologna Book Fair and the title story of the Green Monkey Dream collection won Best short story in the Aurealis Awards when it was published. Darksong won an Aurealis Award in its year. Alyzon Whitestarr won a Golden Aurealis when it was published. Isobelle has also written many books for younger readers.

As alcohol is at the event, you must be over 18 to attend. Please bring a valid form of identification with you on the day just to be sure (Passport or driving license).\nAre children permitted at the event?\nThis is always a tough one. Whilst the answer is a non discriminatory \u2018yes\u2019, our events are often very busy, loud and a little hectic so not an ideal place for little people. We suggest getting a baby sitter and having the day off. We\u2019ll bring the wine.\nWill tickets be available on the door?\nOnly if there are any available. But more often than not, \u2018no\u2019 as the events sell out prior. We cap numbers to ensure everyone has a great time and it\u2019s not too crazy as we want you coming back. We strongly suggest buying tickets prior to ensure you don\u2019t miss out.\nIs there a refund policy?\nRefunds are available on all tickets up to 2 weeks prior to the event. After that date, no dice. If after that time, it\u2019s always good to check on the event facebook pages as often people are looking to purchase ones if the event is sold out.\nI haven\u2019t received my ticket? What do I do?\nAn automated email is sent upon purchasing tickets. If you don\u2019t receive it, it could be for a couple of reasons. Firstly, check the spam folder as sometimes they get stuck there. Other times, when in a rush to purchase (!), some accidentally enter their email address incorrectly. If that\u2019s the case, drop us an email and we\u2019ll search and resend. But all good, you\u2019ll be in our system.\nDo I need to print the tickets.\nIt\u2019s always easier, yes. But, even better is the eventbrite app which keeps them all on your phone. We\u2019ll scan you in when you arrive.\nTasting, not drinking\nWe like to think of these events as a tasting, not a drinking as we want you to experience as many different wine styles on offer. Creating a safe, welcoming and non-intimidating event environment is what we\u2019re all about so any inappropriate behaviour, of an intoxicated nature or not, that is dangerous to yourself and or others, is just not acceptable.\nIf we witness any of the above, we reserve the right to take appropriate action and have you removed from the venue.\nI\u2019ve got a couple of other questions, what should I do?\nEasy. Drop Emily an email at emily@barossa.com\u00a0and she\u2019ll get right back to you.\n\n",

Ayurveda says the most important part of preparing a meal is the consciousness state of the cook... happy present cook = happy life-giving food!\nAfter our minds and bodies have settled into a relaxed state, we dive into creating a nourishing meal together while learning about spices, digestion, food combinations, flavour and all the life-giving tips embodied in the wisdom of Ayurevda. We use only the best fresh, organic, seasonal food and there's a big emphasis on cooking with love and awareness, because you want to enjoy the nourishing of yourself! In each class we cook a different recipe so you can come back and keep exploring ways of creating taste-sensations for everyday of the week.\nTo wrap up the class, we come together and share in the meal we have made; tasting, appreciating and enjoying the simple things in life - food, community and stories. You then get a take-home recipe so you can re-create the meal and see how easy it is to nourish yourself through fresh, wholesome and love-filled cooking.\nOur homestlye Ayurvedic menu:\ndahl\u00a0\nbeetroot curry\u00a0\npumpkin curry\u00a0\ntamarind chutney\u00a0\npink pepper and pistachio dukkah\u00a0\nfresh coconut milk\nSpaces are limited to 10 people and includes a seasonal organic meal, take-home recipe and community hang out.\nI\u2019ll also have homemade organic ghee and spice mixes you can purchase on the morning to start your new Ayurvedic kitchen.\nIf you do not have a meditation practice, i suggest to download the 1giant mind app on your phone (its free) and bring a pair of head phones so you can join us in the meditation.\nSee you there!\nAlex :)",
