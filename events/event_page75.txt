All Retail Traders in Australia need to know how to not only protect their wealth from this collapse but also how to make money from it. \nThe Chinese Economy is incredibly important for the Australian Economy. Predicting the Chinese Economy leads all outcomes in Australian GDP and Financial Markets. Predicting Chinese Macro' trends is therefore incredibly important for Australian investors and traders.\u00a0Notoriously hard to predict due to creative accounting practices and outright exagerration, Chinese Macreconomics and the Macro' landscape leads many investors and traders to false conclusions.

Peloton quickly grew to $2.8Bn in Assets Under Management (AUM) due to an 87% performance in the mortgage fund in 2007. Peloton Partners was named Eurohedge Hedge Fund of the Year in Europe in 2007. In 2008 the Global Financial crisis occurred and forced redemptions at the fund. Something that was out of the control of the firm.

The presentation will be structured around the following four research themes: how conceptually and industrially coherent on the ground are the accepted definitions of the creative industries/creative economy? What is the relationship between the creative industries and discourses and practices advancing innovation?

He is a Member of the Order of Australia and has been a Fulbright Senior Scholar and a Leverhulme Foundation Visitor.

The project sought to: identify the attitudes, knowledge and skills required to develop and run a sustainable creative micro-enterprise, including the acquisition of making/production skills, business skills and acumen, personal capacities and decision-making around self-marketing; analyse the spatial and temporal negotiations necessary to run an online creative micro-enterprise; and examine how the contemporary creative economy contributes to growing ethics-based micro-economic consumer and producer relationships that privileges small-scale production, environmentally-sustainable making practices and the idea of buying direct from the maker.\nSusan Luckman is Professor of Cultural and Creative Industries in the School of Creative Industries and Research Director of the Creative Work Mobilities Research Node, Hawke EU Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence.
