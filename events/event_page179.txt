If you would like me to run it in your city (or company), please get in touch.\nAlso let me know if you would be interested in a shorter or remote (100% online) version of this course.\n\nThe problem\nTeams the world over are struggling with story slicing. They are being asked to deliver working software in short, 2-week cycles (or less) and are finding it very hard to do so.\nWhile the theory of story slicing is easily accessible online, there is little to no training offered to make the theory real and actionable. This course will provide the opportunity to deeply learn the theory while actually practising the techniques using real life scenarios.\n\nWho's it for?\nProduct Managers, Product Owners, Project Managers, Program Managers, UX Designers, Business Analysts, Testers, Programmers\n\nWhy should you attend?\nStory slicing is one of the most misunderstood and misapplied practices in software product development, yet it is arguably the most important to master for teams and organisations looking to increase agility and derive the benefits of doing so (see below).\nContrary to popular belief, story slicing isn't just something a development team does to \"make stories smaller\". It is about identifying options in both the problem and solution space at the right times, collaboratively becoming increasingly precise in what you will build and deliver for customers NOW and what you will defer for later consideration.\nFor maximum effect, story slicing is done holistically by product managers and practitioners right across your company's portfolio, leading to better:\n\n\nSpeed to market\u00a0- improving focus and delivery of valuable working customer solutions within deadlines and market windows\n\n\nPrioritisation - choosing wisely from your options on a frequent basis so you \"build the right thing\"\n\n\nDelivery of useful/valuable increments in shorter timeframes - versions of your product which enable customers to fulfill a need or do a job\n\n\nManagement of risk\u00a0- constraining scope and focusing on outcomes reduces schedule, financial, technical and other forms of business risk\n\n\nUnderstanding of progress\u00a0- holistic story slicing leads to better traceability of tasks and progress of delivery against strategic objectives\n\n\nPredictability - alignment around what is being done and in what timeframes\n\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nOver the 1 or 2 days* you will learn about and practise:\n\n\nThe 3 levels of story slicing: Capability, Functional Implementation and Technical Implementation\n\n\n\"Slicing Heuristics\" - establishing rules for ensuring you have sliced enough and consistently at each level\n\n\nReverse engineering a \"bad\" story - it's never too late to improve a story which seems to lack an end user need or context but has been given to you to implement, or to identify a problem from a solution so you avoid \"building the wrong thing\"\n\n\n\"Slicing Trees\" - workshopping options at different levels using story slicing techniques to create a living, evolving artefact which can be used as a product backlog/roadmap or as an incremental solution/implementation plan\n\n\nLots of techniques for slicing stories and other types of work items\n\n\n*\u00a0The 2-day course is a deeper learning experience of concepts taught and practised on day 1\n\nWhy choose Neil Killick?\nSee my profile below.\n\nWhy is the price so low?\nMost 2-day training workshops in Melbourne cost between $1,300 and $2,000. I am deliberately keeping my prices low to make my courses more accessible to individuals with a limited training budget.\nI am passionate about helping software practitioners improve how they get their work done, and the outcomes of that work. I am hoping my lower prices will mean more people are able to attend my courses, thus increasing the practical knowledge across the industry of how to derive benefits of more agile ways of working.\nI also keep the prices low by:\n\n\nNot using the typical corporate training venues, which both cost more and provide a less inspiring learning environment than other available venues\n\n\nProviding digital rather than printed materials\n\n\nNot providing lunch or other refreshments\n\n",
