Physical first aid is accepted and widespread in our community, however most do not cover mental health problems. Learn how to provide mental health first aid to friends, family members, co-workers and other adults.\u00a0\nWhat is Mental Health First Aid?\u00a0\nMental health first aid (MHFA) is the help provided to a person who is developing a mental health problem, or who is in a mental health crisis (e.g., the person is suicidal or has had a traumatic experience). Like physical first aid, mental health first aid is given until the person receives professional help or until the crisis resolves.\nWhat is the Blended MHFA for Tertiary Students Course\nThe Blended Mental Health First Aid Course for the Tertiary Students is a combination of eLearning plus a half day of face-to-face teaching. The course is for tertiary students. The focus of the course is how to help fellow students though course participants will learn mental health first aid skills that can be applied to help any adult.\nWhat does the the eLearning component cover?\nCourse participants first complete the interactive self-paced eLearning component that presents an overview of mental health problems and mental health crises.\nMental health conditions covered\n\nDepression\u00a0\nAnxiety problems\u00a0\nPsychosis\nEating Disorders\nSubstance use problems\u00a0\n\nMental health crises covered\u00a0\n\nSuicidal thoughts and behaviours\u00a0\nNon-suicidal self-injury\u00a0\nPanic attacks\u00a0\nTraumatic events Severe psychotic states\u00a0\nSevere effects from alcohol or other drug use\nAggressive behaviours.\u00a0\n\nThis is an education course, to learn how to give first aid to others, and is not a therapy or support group.\u00a0\nWhat does the half day session cover?\nThe face-to-face component is designed to be delivered after participants have completed the eLearning component for Tertiary Students. In this face-to-face training, the focus is on the revision and application of knowledge and skills learnt in the eLearning component, providing participants with the opportunity to:\n\nExamine issues pertinent to mental health problems in the student population in more depth\nClarify any points of uncertainty remaining after completion of the eLearning modules\nApply the MHFA Action Plan to relevant scenarios\n\nWho is running the course?\nMental health first aid strategies are taught in evidence-based training courses authored by Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) Australia and delivered by accredited MHFA Instructors across the country. This is a standardised course developed by Mental Health First Aid Australia, and has been customised by accredited MHFA Instructor\u00a0Emma Boucher\u00a0\u00a0to incorporate relevant examples and local information.\nWhat is the course format?\nThis is a 4 hour face to face session run from 9am until 1pm. Participants must have completed the eLearning component in order to register for the face to face session. Haven\u2019t completed the eLearning as yet? Register here\u00a0\nWho can attend?\nAny tertiary student over the age of 18 that has completed the eLearning component.\nWhat is the cost?\nThe cost of the face to face session is $70. This include the 4 hour training package, materials and morning tea.\nWhy should I attend a course?\nEvaluations consistently show that MHFA training is associated with improved knowledge of mental illnesses, their treatments and appropriate first aid strategies, and confidence in providing first aid to individuals with mental illness. It is also associated with decreased stigma and an increase in help provided.\nCan I get Accredited as a MHFA Officer?\u00a0\nYes! Demonstrate your mental health first aid skills by becoming an Accredited Mental Health First Aider. Complete an online assessment after the course to become Accredited as a MHFA Officer for 3 years.\nHow do I register?\nSimply follow the eventbrite ink to register and make payment.\nWho do I contact for further details?\nEmma Boucher,\u00a0eboucher@bigpond.net.au\u00a0or 0416 147 443",

                "text": "Morning Session\u00a0 9.00 - 12.00\u00a0 Why Weight Matters\nWheelchair manufacturers often promote having the lightest wheelchairs made of the lightest materials. Does this matter? And, if so how much? Understanding the benefits of a lighter wheelchair is essential for the user and anyone involved in the wheelchair industry. The decisions you make when ordering and setting up a wheelchair will impact wheelchair weight and efficiency and can have a significant effect on user function, independence and safety.\n\nAfternoon Session 1.30 - 4.30 Center of Gravity & Optimising Manual Wheelchairs\nWhen selecting an appropriate manual wheelchair, we often focus on the features and benefits of the selected product; or default to the familiar.\u00a0 However, we may be doing our client\u2019s a disservice by not considering the form and function of the wheelchair.\u00a0 How does design and material selection impact functional performance and can it make a difference for our clients? This presentation will discuss basic material science and the impact that frame construction may have on our client\u2019s ability to function more independently.\u00a0\u00a0We will help to define Centre of Gravity (COG)\u00a0 and will examine the impact of changes in COG and discuss the clinical rationale and treatment approaches to maximise function, safety and maintain upper extremity health for manual wheelchair users. With so many options, we need to consider all aspects to differentiate and choose the most appropriate product for our clients.\nPresented By:\u00a0Tina Roelser MSPT, ABDA, She\u00a0has\u00a0a wealth of knowledge and experience and has worked in our industry for over 17 years. Tina has held many notable positions such as Director of Education for The ROHO Group and, most recently Director of International Sales and Education with TiLite. She has presented at numerous global conferences and has experience in sales, market development, training and education, marketing and product development.\n\nPlease feel free to attend both sessions.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: after much discussion Linds has decided to charge a small fee to reserve your space if you have any questions\u00a0please don't hesitate to contact us.",
