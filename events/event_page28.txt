A space for safe conversations about your experiences and feeling around the patriarchy and gender based violence in the Asia Pacific. 35% of all women older than 15 years have experienced physical violence from a partner, or some form of sexual violence. 1 in 3 Australian trans-women have been assaulted with a weapon. Vulval or female genital cutting affects more than 100 million people alive today. 95% of girls in Nepal have restrictions during their period. A culture of toxic masculinity contributes to this reality. We experience the daily objectification that creates entitlement to our bodies: rape. We experience the stereotyping that devalues our intelligence and contribution to society: the gender pay gap. Gender based violence is the symptom of gender roles and sexism in our society as it intersects with other forms of societal oppression (racism, heterosexism, transexism, ableism etc.). We invite all non-cis men who traverse the complex landscape of this unequal world to share our experiences, listen, learn from each other and, you know what, just vent, escape and cope with the toxic effects of sexism.
