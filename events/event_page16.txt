                "text": "\nGreetings Tribe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to this Healing Tribe Cacao Sound Journey. The sacred Cacao is a heart opening and grounding medicine, and will be guided with the Medicine drum, chanting, ancient Didjeridu, and Native American flutes. We will embark on a journey of meditation to receive the Cacao and sound vibrations. During the sound healing immerse in these organic sounds and vibrations. Feel the resonance of the Didjeridu, deep within your heart space, as it passes over your physical body. As the journey evolves using earthly beats of drums allow the Cacao to guide you into deeper states of healing and mediation, even invoke expressions of movement, or unleash tribal dance. The choice is entirely yours on how you wish to receive the Cacao and sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n- It is advisable to avoid eating a large meal before the journey, and best to also stay well hydrated with water.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the facilitators:\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Suhrou \u2013 Gathering the teachings from the elders and shamans of her tribe she channels into several healing practices and teachings such as Shamanism, Reiki, Crystal Healing, and Sound Vibrations. Together with a shaman drum and her beautiful voice she chants a song of deep spiritual healing.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Dimarco - offering the soundscape with live wind instruments, didjeridu and vocal overtones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeace\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPS - Please let us know beforehand if you are taking any medications, as we will need to adjust your dose accordingly.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nDoors open 7:00 pm, for a 7:30 pm start. Paperless check-in using ID or phone e-ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Arriving after the journey begins may distrupt the flow.

The sacred Cacao is a heart opening and grounding medicine, and will be guided with the Medicine drum, chanting, ancient Didjeridu, and Native American flutes. We will embark on a journey of meditation to receive the Cacao and sound vibrations. During the sound healing immerse in these organic sounds and vibrations. Feel the resonance of the Didjeridu, deep within your heart space, as it passes over your physical body. As the journey evolves using earthly beats of drums allow the Cacao to guide you into deeper states of healing and mediation, even invoke expressions of movement, or unleash tribal dance.

                "text": "Motov8ing Boys is an event for boys aged 11-17 and their parents.\nDo you worry about your son\u2019s behaviour or attitude; or maybe he needs help building his confidence?\nDoes your son struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr maybe you're tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse get no response at all?\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. Unfortunately this often leads to various problems at home, at school and with friends both on & off line.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motivating Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8?\nJohn is a youth specialist with over 27years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across South East Victoria. Through the \"Ride of Life\" & Raging Bull seminars, delivered in schools, John has helped influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nWhilst the clich\u00e9 statement \"Boys will be boys\" is a often used to explain why boys do silly things, as a personal coach/mentor and parent himself, John would rather see this statement reflect a different sentiment. John and his company, Motov8, aim to inspire boys to choose to become awesome young men rather than just accept what others say they will be.\u00a0\nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?\nMotov8ting Boys' is an event for Pre-teen and Teenage Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; to assist them to understand the power of positive attitude, develop confidence, change destructive behaviour, Identify personal potential & understand the importance of self respect & respecting others. \nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's this same reason they don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nSo after talking with school principals, community leaders & parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking & screaming.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.\nThere will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 & KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt & road racing.\nWhat parents are saying about this event & The Rev.\nEmma Munnoch Dec 6th Perth event.\u00a0 Inspiration and hope knowing we as parents of young Male teens are not alone in this journey. We all come with a past and should not let that effect our future potential...hearing Revs story was so close to my sons experiences at school....we are committed to help make change....every school needs a opportunity like this to help boys reach their fullest potential. My son thought it was wicked and as a family that follows moto gp and rides dirt bikes can really relate to the analogies made. He also said it was like a weight lifted when our family shared an experience that was quite traumatic to us all...I am sure this night has opened the gates of communication for our son to move forward and to talk about what's been holding him back. Blake and Josh also made him feel great at the end of the night too. Well done Rev and gang.\n\nCourtney Ekenberg Dec 3rd Ringwood event.\u00a0 The best part of tonight was walking out of there and hearing my son tell me how great that was. We spoke for a good 15 minutes during our drive home, and 15 minutes is a long time for my son! He had this drive and positive attitude that had him talking about, not only his problems but what he can do to make things better. He had that feeling of reassurance that he has the ability to make a change and to be one. I'm so grateful for the time Rev gave my son after the seminar. Just enough to encourage him. We loved hearing all about his life story and the rawness to it. It was real and you just can't bet that. Thank you MotoV8 for being apart of this journey, that we (parents and teenages) are just trying to figure out.\nAnnette Sayers Dec 3rd Ringwood event.\u00a0 Wow.... I attended Motov8 boys in Ringwood tonight and as disappointed as I was that my 15 yr old didn\u2019t attend, I was truly grateful and blown away with the Rev share and the connection he made with the boys and parents in the room.\u00a0 Rev speaks from his heart, sharing his vulnerability and connecting through storytelling. This event is for boys and as much for parents. It guides parents into creating awareness into parenting, allows parents to shine a light on whats not working and gives them strategics to be able to handle raising teenagers. \u201cIt\u2019s tough being a teen and it\u2019s even tougher raising one!\u201d, - REV\u00a0 \u201cIF YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS DONE, YOU WILL ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS GOT\u201d - Albert Einstein and many others.\u00a0 If you are thinking about attending one of Rev\u2019s events, NOW is the time to say YES to you and your family. DO IT for you, DO IT for your kids. DO IT for your family. We are all worth it.\u00a0 Thank you Rev, rock on, love your work. \nFloss Cubbin Nov 17th Grafton NSW event. Rev held a workshop in Grafton. It was completely different to what I was expecting but was exactly what young boys/ teens can relate to.\u00a0 The fact that he shares his personal experiences and is brave enough to discuss personal issues is exactly what the youth need. To know it\u2019s ok to reach out, to know that we don\u2019t always make the best choices but there is always someone there to help u out and it\u2019s never too late.\u00a0 Rev seemed very perceptive in knowing what signs to look for and had some useful strategies that can help. I would recommend one of his workshops and I\u2019m looking forward to his return next year.\u00a0 Thanks again\n\nKylie Messanger Nov 13th Grafton NSW event.\u00a0 Rev... Your impact is huge not just on the kids but on the parents... Thank you for keeping it real & thank you for telling it how it is. I loved seeing the impression you had on some of those boys tonight who stood up and told you just how awesome you made them feel. You have changed their lives and empowered them in one session. That imprinted in my heart - an emotional moment and they weren't even my sons'.\u00a0 Thank you for telling your story and I can't wait for the next session - we will be there for sure! Again thank you for just being you.\u00a0 Good luck with our besties in Grafton tomorrow they won't be disappointed. The word spreads quickly!\nSeona Maybery My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2.5hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So so much to take away from this workshop. \nSo turn off the TV, Xbox or PS4 and bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some good advice that could just change your and their lives forever.",
