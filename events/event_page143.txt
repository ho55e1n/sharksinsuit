                "text": "Learning Experience and Career Planning of Masters Students in Hong Kong\nDr. Jisun Jung (Assistant Professor, The University of Hong Kong)\nIncreasing numbers of students are pursuing a growing and diverse range of master\u2019s degree programmes, and yet this level of higher education has received less research attention than the undergraduate and doctoral levels. Student profiles in master\u2019s degree programmes are also changing including a greater number of part-time students, working professionals, and international students. They also have different motivations, learning experiences, and career planning. The study aims to explore what the economic, social, and academic motivations are to enter a master\u2019s program and how students in master\u2019s programs perceive their learning experience and career opportunities. This study also focuses on different perceptions in learning experience between local students and international students. The study was based on 70 qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of master\u2019s students in various types of degree in Hong Kong.\nThe preliminary findings show that master\u2019s students have various motivations in pursuing their degrees. For example, the results show that economic motivations, such as better job opportunities, skill learning, career development, promotion potential and incentives offered by their current employer, are important aspects of their decision. In addition, social motivations were also mentioned, such as securing a better chance at social mobility, earning social credentials, forming networks and gaining a better alumni reputation. The study also found pure scholarly motivations or enjoyment of learning as well. Interestingly, motivations and learning experiences differed by students\u2019 backgrounds. In particular, international students tend to have clearer goal and career planning since they enter the programme and enjoy the learning environment and interaction with teachers, however, they tend to have difficulties to be integrated in new learning styles and Chinese dominated culture. The study aims to provide implications for master\u2019s degree programmes in terms of its curriculum structure and support for students. \n\nDr. Jisun Jung\nJisun Jung\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong since 2015. She received a PhD from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2011, and she was a postdoctoral fellow and lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. Her current research focuses on academic profession, doctoral education in East Asia, and learning experiences and employability of master\u2019s students. She recently co-edited two books with Springer, \u201cChanging Academic Profession in Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cResearching Higher Education in Asia\u201d. She also co-edited two special issues, \u201cHigher Education Research in East Asia\u201d in Higher Education Policy\u00a0and \u201cGraduate Employment and Higher Education in East Asia\u201d in the\u00a0International Journal of Chinese Education.

The study also found pure scholarly motivations or enjoyment of learning as well. Interestingly, motivations and learning experiences differed by students\u2019 backgrounds. In particular, international students tend to have clearer goal and career planning since they enter the programme and enjoy the learning environment and interaction with teachers, however, they tend to have difficulties to be integrated in new learning styles and Chinese dominated culture. The study aims to provide implications for master\u2019s degree programmes in terms of its curriculum structure and support for students. <BR><BR></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><A HREF=\"https://web.edu.hku.hk/staff/academic/jisun\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN><IMG ALT=\"Jisun Jung\" SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/193693776/jisun.png\"></SPAN></IMG></A></P>\n<H3 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><SPAN>Dr. Jisun Jung<BR></SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><A HREF=\"https://web.edu.hku.hk/staff/academic/jisun\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jisun Jung</A><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN>is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong since 2015.

That person talks about either: (a) a single specific challenge that they bring to the event, or (b) a broader set of life experiences that they would prefer to be different.\n\n** That all sounds very simple! How does it Work? **  The other participants ask questions from a space of curiosity about the focus person's experience of themselves. This process is coached by the facilitator to keep the questions curious rather than allowing people to offer advice or their own interpretations.  This is not therapy in that we do not give advice or see anyone being circled as in any way broken. The main focus of the questions is to engage with the person being 'Circled' - deeper than their stories and illusions and socially-created self-perceptions. Very basically this process works by providing multiple new perspectives of the person to themselves. Just like different people in a dark cave shining torches on a mysterious treasure. The more torches there are, the more the treasure is revealed.  Group sizes are typically 5-8 to make sure that there's plenty of time for each person. There's a break in the middle of the afternoon for snacks.
