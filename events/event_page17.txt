The night will be filled with surprises, ranging from special guests Jane Marie & The Super Vixens to video projections from Rhys Newling.Tickets will be $10 pre-sale and at the door and 100% of ticket sales will go to the charity Beyond Blue. In Australia, it's estimated that 45 per cent of people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime. In any one year, around 1 million Australian adults have depression, and over 2 million have anxiety. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44, about 200 people in Australia attempt suicide every day and of those, on average, eight will die. (Statistics from www.beyondblue.org.au)If you or someone you know needs help, please contact Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14 - you are not alone.We are passionate about increasing awareness about mental health issues and want to be a part of the conversation by helping to erase the stigma associated with this.Bernadette Novembre and her 10 piece band have been making waves around Australia and Internationally with her unique brand of Soul. The band have recently played support to Kylie Auldist and Tim Ries (Saxophonist for The Rolling Stones) and were part of the lineup for the 2019 St Kilda Festival. Bernadette's songs have gained not only local airplay on radio stations such as PBS, Tripe R, Joy FM & Triple J, but they have also gained the attention of International Radio such as Binky Griptite's (Dap-King and guitarist for the late Amy Winehouse) 'The Boogie Down' on WFUV in New York.Here's what people are saying about Bernadette - \"When Bernadette Novembre brings a show you can be sure she will bring the soul and that the room will pop\" - Justin Stanford (The Night Cat)\"Music gives strength to the soul - Soul music comes from the heart - Bernadette sings from her heart\" - John Bailey (Triple R)\"Bernadette has a true and original sound, whilst echoing the hallmarks of some of the great soul vocalists\" - Ryan Phelan (7 Network)\"This album gets deeper with every track in. Bernadette\u2019s classic delivery takes you for the adventure. And wow, that band is cooking\" - Adam Scone (World renowned Hammond Organist)\"When Bernadette is going to play live, you put that date in your diary because you don\u2019t want to miss the party\" - James Young (Cherry Bar)\"Melbourne singer, songwriter and performance powerhouse, Bernadette Novembre never fails to bring the sultry and seductive to the smoothest Soul and turn up the grit and groove for the most menacing Garage sounds. That little hint of Rocksteady rhythm is also pretty sweet and on the beat. As the Four Tops sang - they can't control Bernadette. We're proud to have the \"Rebounding\" EP in the Rocksteady Records racks\" -Pat Monaghan (Rocksteady Records)",

                "text": "Discwoman has unquestionably changed the political landscape of dance music. Founded by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, Emma Burgess-Olson and Christine McCharen-Tran in September 2014, started as a two-day festival at Bossa Nova in New York, Discwoman has grown into a collective, artist agency, and event platform that unapologetically subverts expectations, breaks norms, and amplifies voices of the marginalised. In and outside of the club, they have fearlessly lead the global discourse around gender imbalance on club and festival lineups since their inception in 2014. On Saturday, April 27th at The SUBSTATION, we are proud to present a showcase of one of the most important collectives in dance music, and a group of incredible women that have inspired us for years. UMFANG (Discwoman | NYC) https://soundcloud.com/umfang UMFANG is a force of nature behind the decks that has always kept building her community at the core of her ethos. As a DJ, she favours old, blisteringly fast minimal techno cuts, spinning together stark, polyrhythmic, loop-based tracks with a frantic urgency and intensity. The traits of her selections mirror the current-day political climate of the globe - they are equal parts dizzying and engrossing, intense, and full of unexpected twists and turns. Her productions carry the starkness of her DJ sets, taming the energy levels while mesmerising with subtlety and space. UMFANG\u2019s DIY and feminist values manifest in both her work as an artist and community builder. Since 2013 she has held her monthly Technofeminism residency at legendary New York City institution Bossa Nova Civic Club, focusing on providing a platform emerging talent to blossom. For years she has taught CDJ lessons and conducted DJ workshops for beginner artists, spoken on panels advocating for more inclusive dance music culture, and smashed barriers limiting access of women, femme, and gender non-conforming people to the key positions in the scene. SHYBOI (Discwoman | NYC) https://soundcloud.com/djshyboi Jamaican-born, New York based SHYBOI fuses fierce rap, ragga, and dancehall strains into searing techno and bass heaters. She actively disrupts sonic hierarchies and genre conventions through her high-impact, eclectic selections. As a multidisciplinary creative - a performance and video artist in addition to a DJ and emerging producer - her work has a strong conceptual bent. As a creative positioned between Caribbean and American culture, she uses sound to interrogate ideas of identity, notions of power, perceived histories and the entanglements that happens within these topics. The past year has seen thunderous momentum building for SHYBOI, with an incredible range of bookings ranging from supporting DJ Stingray on tour, playing the main stage of Aurora Halal\u2019s Sustain-Release festival, disorienting punters with a blindingly intense set at Unsound Krakow, or subverting normative techno aesthetics in institutions like Berghain and De School. A true renegade and boundary-pusher, SHYBOI is part of a new wave of artists moving past convention and forging a new path. Makeda https://soundcloud.com/alldaybreakfast Musician, DJ, and multi-disciplinary experimentalist Makeda explores post-capitalist futures through diaphanous electronic swirls. Sketching a svelte aural palette, she has performed locally and internationally at festivals and clubs including Dark Mofo, RVNG International\u2019s \u2018Commend\u2019 store, Cool Room, Soft Centre, the Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts, and Bossa Nova Civic Club - alongside a diverse range of artists including Klein, Oscar Key Sung, Elysia Crampton, Gramrcy and Inga Mauer. As a DJ, Makeda started out on Brisbane\u2019s iconic 4ZZZ community station, and has since been featured on stations including Hope St Radio, Triple J and The Lot NYC and Red Light Radio, whilst lighting up dancefloors in Europe, New York, and her current home of Melbourne. Her production and DJing is informed by her identity as diaspora, reexamining and deconstructing hardcore, jungle and other musics at the intersection of her British and Caribbean heritage. She maintains an expert control of pace and balance in her sets, treading a delicate tightrope between experimental and accessible; fun and challenging; playful and severe. ~~~ We would like to acknowledge that this event is being held on the stolen land. We wish to acknowledge the custodians of this land, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation and their Elders past, present, and emerging. An allocation of free tickets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are available \u2013 please DM the Cool Room page and we will organise a free. THE SUBSTATION is fully wheelchair accessible and has a wheelchair accessible toilet. For any accessibility questions or concerns, please contact Cool Room.",

The kind of music that's all about those funky, visceral grooves that you just can't help but dance your ass off to until your legs give out. With influences such as Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Earth, Wind & Fire, Bruno Mars, Prince and Marvin Gaye, Jourdain sings with all the passion and vigour that embodied the legendary age of soul from the late '60s to the early '80s. And of course, there's the falsetto singing that Jourdain has become renowned for. With an incredible group of musicians making up Jourdain's band including Alex Hughes on guitar, Jack Parker on keys, Otis Suffolk-Lyons on drums, Shane Andison on bass, Andr\u00e9 Lew on sax and Lucca Franco on BVs, this show is all set to be a highlight of April.

Once a bus tour has sold out, we make this option available for people that really need a tour date.\nHowever, we suggest that, if possible, you purchase \"normal\" tickets for the next tour. You can find all New To Melbourne tour dates on the New To Melbourne facebook page here:\nwww.facebook.com/NewToMelb/events\nBelow is more information about backup tickets for this tour if you would like to join the group.\nHave a great time! :-)New To Melbourne\n===== IMPORTANT\u00a0=====Backup tickets are only available once a tour sells out. They\u2019re designed for people that have friends going on a tour and that missed out on tickets, or those that are leaving Melbourne shortly and can\u2019t make another date or who are otherwise really need to get on a tour but that tried buying too late.\u00a0They're a great option if you really need to get on a tour and are happy to take a chance that there will be room on the day.\nAs the name \"backup\" indicates, the tickets can't guarentee you a seat on the bus (however the refund is 100% guarenteed if there's no room). There's a 50%-90% likelihood that seats will be available on the day and you'll be able to board on the day. The likelihood of being able to board is listed on each ticket type - please see options on the \"buy a ticket\" page.This option was created to help people that really need to get on a tour but missed out on tickets.\n\n===== Why do we have backup tickets? =====\nWe have on average 3-5 people who don\u2019t show up on the day for a tour and they don't message us to let us know that they can\u2019t make it. A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0\nAs mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.\nWe suggest buying these tickets if:- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.\n===== Groups\u00a0=====DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.\n===== Boarding process\u00a0=====Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:\n\nArrive at the meeting point\nLet the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket\nWait until everyone has boarded the bus\nAsk the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.\n\nIf there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)\nNOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.\n\nNew to Melbourne:www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\u00a0\nWe hope that this option is helpful for you :-)\nBest regards,New To Melbourne Team",

A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0</P>\n<P>As mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.</P>\n<P>We suggest buying these tickets if:<BR>- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets<BR>- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for<BR>- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.</P>\n<P>===== Groups\u00a0=====<BR>DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.</P>\n<P>===== Boarding process\u00a0=====<BR>Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:</P>\n<OL>\n<LI>Arrive at the meeting point</LI>\n<LI>Let the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket</LI>\n<LI>Wait until everyone has boarded the bus</LI>\n<LI>Ask the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>If there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)</P>\n<P>NOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>New to Melbourne:<BR><A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.facebook.com/NewToMelb</A>\u00a0</P>\n<P>We hope that this option is helpful for you :-)</P>\n<P>Best regards,<BR>New To Melbourne Team</P>"

We allow 1.5 hours for this activity, but our volunteers often want to remove more! Boneseed removal is chemical-free, doesn't need any special equipment and is easy!\nAustralia is a\u00a0 wonderful place to see wildlife. Part of the day will be spent watching wild koalas in their natural habitat. You will be accompanied by two wildlife professionals who will guide you through the You Yangs national park. We will also introduce you to the koalas known from 20 years of koala research in the area.\nCost:\u00a0$30 adults, $20 children/student/concession\nThis small donation goes directly back to koals and allows us to keep doing the amazing research and hands on work we do! and trust us.. the nature experience our volunteers get is well worth it!\nGetting there?\nThe meeting place for the day is Little River Hotel (Pub) 10/14 Flinders St, Little River\u00a0at 9:00am, we will then travel as a group to the location in the You Yangs.\u00a0As this location differs every week, please meet us at the designated spot as we do not meet people within the You Yangs. \nLittle River Hotel Google Maps Link\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you can't get to Little River we offer a city transport add on to your ticket for $5.

After five to six years of growth, the time it takes to go through highschool, a tree is big enough to house a koala.\u00a0\u00a0In tree planting months there may not be enough time to visit the park and see koalas, but we do make it on most of our trips.\nExperiencing wild Australia is enhanced by seeing songbirds, kangaroos, wallabies, reptiles and wildflowers. We take strolls through the bushland to relax in the sights and sounds of nature.\n*\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nTransport from the city is available, please book the city transport add on in addition to your ticket.
