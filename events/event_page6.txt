Once a bus tour has sold out, we make this option available for people that really need a tour date.\nHowever, we suggest that, if possible, you purchase \"normal\" tickets for the next tour. You can find all New To Melbourne tour dates on the New To Melbourne facebook page here:\nwww.facebook.com/NewToMelb/events\nBelow is more information about backup tickets for this tour if you would like to join the group.\nHave a great time! :-)New To Melbourne\n===== IMPORTANT\u00a0=====Backup tickets are only available once a tour sells out. They\u2019re designed for people that have friends going on a tour and that missed out on tickets, or those that are leaving Melbourne shortly and can\u2019t make another date or who are otherwise really need to get on a tour but that tried buying too late.\u00a0They're a great option if you really need to get on a tour and are happy to take a chance that there will be room on the day.\nAs the name \"backup\" indicates, the tickets can't guarentee you a seat on the bus (however the refund is 100% guarenteed if there's no room). There's a 50%-90% likelihood that seats will be available on the day and you'll be able to board on the day. The likelihood of being able to board is listed on each ticket type - please see options on the \"buy a ticket\" page.This option was created to help people that really need to get on a tour but missed out on tickets.\n\n===== Why do we have backup tickets? =====\nWe have on average 3-5 people who don\u2019t show up on the day for a tour and they don't message us to let us know that they can\u2019t make it. A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0\nAs mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.\nWe suggest buying these tickets if:- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.\n===== Groups\u00a0=====DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.\n===== Boarding process\u00a0=====Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:\n\nArrive at the meeting point\nLet the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket\nWait until everyone has boarded the bus\nAsk the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.\n\nIf there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)\nNOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.\n\nNew to Melbourne:www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\u00a0\nWe hope that this option is helpful for you :-)\nBest regards,New To Melbourne Team",

There's a 50%-90% likelihood that seats will be available on the day and you'll be able to board on the day. The likelihood of being able to board is listed on each ticket type - please see options on the \"buy a ticket\" page.<BR><BR>This option was created to help people that really need to get on a tour but missed out on tickets.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>===== Why do we have backup tickets? =====</P>\n<P>We have on average 3-5 people who don\u2019t show up on the day for a tour and they don't message us to let us know that they can\u2019t make it. A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0</P>\n<P>As mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.</P>\n<P>We suggest buying these tickets if:<BR>- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets<BR>- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for<BR>- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.</P>\n<P>===== Groups\u00a0=====<BR>DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.</P>\n<P>===== Boarding process\u00a0=====<BR>Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:</P>\n<OL>\n<LI>Arrive at the meeting point</LI>\n<LI>Let the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket</LI>\n<LI>Wait until everyone has boarded the bus</LI>\n<LI>Ask the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>If there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)</P>\n<P>NOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>New to Melbourne:<BR><A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.facebook.com/NewToMelb</A>\u00a0</P>\n<P>We hope that this option is helpful for you :-)</P>\n<P>Best regards,<BR>New To Melbourne Team</P>"
