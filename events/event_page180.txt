                "text": "\nThe Mindfulness Works exclusive 4-week introductory course provides you with an opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness.\nWHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?\n\n4 x classes\u00a0\n45-page guidebook\n4 week free gift subscription to the Calm premium mindfulness app\nWeekly emails with extra articles and instructions\nDownloadable guided mindfulness meditations for you to keep\n\nABOUT MINDFULNESS WORKS\nMindfulness Works is one of Australia's largest mindfulness training organisation. Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\u00a0\nNO RELIGION. NO DOGMA. NO FUNNY POSITIONS:\u00a0 This course is practical and fun with no religious elements at all. We sit in chairs, the language used is clear and modern.\nEXPERIENCED AND WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHERS:Receive guidance from experienced mindfulness teachers who have received our Mindfulness Works teacher training and partake in ongoing professional development.\n\nCOURSE TOPICS:\nWeek 1: What is Mindfulness and What are the Benefits?\nWeek 2: Mindfulness and The Thinking Mind\nWeek 3: Mindfulness and Emotions\nWeek 4: Mindfulness and Self-Compassion\n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE SUITABLE FOR?\nThis course is suitable for absolute beginners who have no or very little mindfulness and meditation experience. This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS JOAN CORNISH\n\nJoan is a\u00a0wellbeing coach, who finds time spent in nature to be the greatest healer. She uses a blend of mindfulness, coaching, NLP and Hawaiian bodywork to help others embrace life with greater self-awareness and joy.\nA long-time meditator, Joan knows firsthand how practising mindfulness is one of the most important things we can do to free ourselves from worry, judgement, self-criticism and struggle. She sees sharing mindfulness skills as a gift, and a way to help build greater compassion in the world.\nWhen she\u2019s not working one-on-one to assist clients to find and follow their bliss, Joan leads wellbeing walks and workshops for women. With a focus on compassion, creativity and connection, her Soul Food Sundays program provides the opportunity to experience firsthand the benefits of nature-based therapy. Through simple guides exercises, Joan shows how regular mindful walks can calm a busy mind, boost the immune system and enhance your sense of connectedness to yourself and the world around you.\nJoan practises daily\u00a0yoga\u00a0and is a committed student of Self-knowledge. With many years in designing behaviour change environmental programs and a lifetime interest in personal development, she brings a unique blend of insights on how we create change both within ourselves and at the community level.\n\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.

                "text": "\nThe Mindfulness Works exclusive 4-week introductory course provides you with an opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness.\nWHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?\n\n4 x classes\u00a0\n45-page guidebook\n4 week free gift subscription to the Calm premium mindfulness app\nWeekly emails with extra articles and instructions\nDownloadable guided mindfulness meditations for you to keep\n\nABOUT MINDFULNESS WORKS\nMindfulness Works is one of Australia's largest mindfulness training organisation. Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.

She\u00a0began studying and practising mindfulness, meditation and yoga.\nThese practices had such a profound and extraordinary impact in her life that she wanted\u00a0to share these skills with others. So 10\u00a0years ago, Karen studied to become a Meditation and Yoga teacher and currently runs a successful Yoga and meditation business.\nKaren\u2019s background in science (Registered Nurse) led her to explore and look for evidence-based mindfulness practice. She began studying Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) with Dr Russ Harris (author of\u00a0The Happiness Trap), the\u00a0basis of which is mindfulness practice.\nShe was looking for a way to make these valuable skills accessible to everyone without having to be traditionally interested in spirituality; bridging the gap between science and spirituality.\nKaren also works in the corporate world, training health professionals to become coaches. She is able to deliver a perfect balance to this world using mindfulness practices\u00a0and\u00a0combines a wealth of training delivery experience into high-performance group facilitation.\nKaren keenly continues her own personal journey and is currently studying with Dr Joe Dispenza (author of\u00a0Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind) who uses the latest findings from the fields of neuroscience and quantum physics to not only heal illness but also to enjoy a more fulfilled and happy life through meditation\nKaren has a great love for learning, applying and teaching and is very excited about sharing these skills with you.\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.
