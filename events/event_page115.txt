Participants will work out what their blog will contain and get ideas/advice from their fellow workshoppers. \n\u00a0\nNote: BYOD (Bring your own device) \nWhy should I attend?\n Learning to blog effectively brings together many great benefits such as knowing how to write in an engaging manner for broader audiences, focused networking, participating in (and leading!) conversations around your areas of expertise, and clarity around your research purpose.\n\u00a0Who should attend? \nParticipants from Workshop 1, or researchers who have started a blog and are interested in knowing more about longer-term blog management. \nAbout the facilitators:\nThe \u2018Blogging your research\u2019 program is presented by two experienced academic bloggers. \nDr James Burford founded and manages the Conference Inference blog, which focuses on the world of scholarly conferences. He runs the blog with his colleague Emily Henderson (University of Warwick, UK). \nDr Tseen Khoo founded and manages the Research Whisperer blog, which features posts about research cultures, funding and grants, and life as an academic. She runs the blog with her colleague Jonthan O\u2019Donnell (RMIT University). \nJamie and Tseen are the co-managers of the RED Alert blog. ",

Using both plenary and group activities, we expect you to leave the workshop with a better understanding of what supervision of peers and colleagues means and the different models of peer/colleague supervision. You will discuss effective supervision and its outcomes, alongside barriers and enablers to effective supervision of peers/colleagues. You will also explore ways to evaluate supervision of learners in your own health or human services contexts. The focus of this workshop will be on the restorative (supportive) functions of supervision and will cover the principles of self-care, supervisors supporting supervisees, and supportive workplace cultures.
