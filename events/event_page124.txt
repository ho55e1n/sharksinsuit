If you don't have a craft you can hire one of ours for a very small fee.\u00a0 To pre-register and book a craft, simply choose the ticket that refers to what you need and we will see you on the day. Ocean Crusaders will also provide our new rescue vessel Sweeper on the day to support paddlers and swap bags of rubbish out.\u00a0\n\nDon't have a paddle craft, then never fear, several local groups will be organising separate clean up sites.\u00a0 More details to come shortly on these locations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is a fun family event and our team will conduct an audit on the debris on the day to enter data into the Australian Marine Debris Initiative Database so if you don't want to get out on the water you can certainly help with that.\u00a0 We will finish off with a BBQ and a few cold refreshments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEach of the groups involved will also have a display showing you what they do in the local environment and hence you have an opportunity to sign up with them for ongoing programs on the river and surrounds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe event will be hosted at the park adjacent to the Ski Club on Simpson St.\u00a0 Look for the banners.\n\nFor more details contact Ian on 0412 932 808 or info@oceancrusaders.org",

However, maintaining your leadership effectiveness and efficiency during conflict, high stress and tight deadlines is significantly more difficult.\nIn this program, you will work directly with Dr. Mike Larson (Head Performance Coach and Emotional Intelligence Specialist) on how to effectively manage yourself and your emotions to achieve peak performance during even the most difficult leadership circumstances.\u00a0\n\nOur team of trainers has worked for, and with, organisations large and small (such as Apple, EY, NAB, AMP and Toyota) in hiring, training and up-skilling individuals in Peak Performance, Emotional Intelligence (EQ), and Leadership and Culture Building.\nDon\u2019t miss out on taking your career to the next level. \n\nThe Early Birds get a massive worm! 50% off to be exact (Edit: Only five (5) discount tickets left!).\nClick 'Tickets' to reserve your seat today.\n\nWhy Develop Your Ability To Reach Peak Performance?\nTough times, stress and conflict are inevitable... and without the right emotional intelligence (EQ) skillset, each of these emotionally taxing factors will dramatically reduce your performance and effectiveness as a leader.\u00a0\nHaving unwavering consistency in your performance is one benefit of having high Emotional Intelligence. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t hide or fake your Emotional Intelligence from others. Every client, co-worker, boss or friend witnesses how you deal with your own emotions, as well as how you influence others, every time they interact with you. At Pillar Leaders, we use emotional intelligence theories and strategies as a model to understand and develop the skills you need to be a high performing leader.\nThe culmination of these skills predictably results in career advancement into positions with higher leadership responsibilities (and salaries). Conversely, those who avoid or fail to consistently improve their emotional intelligence and perform at their best will often find themselves stagnant in the same role for extended periods, are overlooked during promotions, or frequently jump around from company to company experiencing the same roadblocks to their career (we do not recommend any of these outcomes).\n\nWho should attend:\nThe \u201cHow To Become A High-Performing Leader\u201d is an application-based, high-impact performance masterclass aimed at teaching you the techniques you need to achieve peak performance & efficiency under stress and pressure. It will benefit individuals who:\n\n\n\nWork in competitive or high-stress environments.\n\n\nWant to stay emotionally calm and in control, and perform at your best even under stressful situations.\n\n\nNeed to be able to navigate complex or difficult relationships.\n\n\nHave or want increased leadership or management responsibilities.\n\n\nWork in a collaborative team environment (which may include conflict driven co-workers).\n\n\nSeek to confidently handle client relationships.\n\n\nAre ambitious leaders who want to have success in their career and avoid the stagnation.\n\n\n\nYou will learn:\n\n\nThe exact leadership skills that predict and drive consistent high-performance... and why each skill will (or won\u2019t) work for specific situations.\n\n\nThe core concepts of emotional intelligence and how high performing leaders use them to manage emotions without appearing \u2018cold\u2019.\n\n\nSystematic methods to ensure leadership challenges never boil over into frustration, reduce your effectiveness or derail you from your goals.\n\n\nSpecific strategies to rapidly return to optimal performance after becoming stressed, frustrated or unmotivated (TIP: our step-by-step resilience matrix makes it quick, simple, and nearly impossible to mess up!).\n\n\nHow to improve your self-awareness and learn how to identify your strengths and weaknesses (the #1 predictor of success for leaders).\n\n\nDr. Mike\u2019s Top Tips for increasing your motivation and reducing your stress, along with some quick hacks that will work for you the next day (even if you work with conflict driven co-workers).\n\n\n\nClick 'tickets' now and join us.

The event team (you and your classmates) then meet at the event office where you\u2019ll be immersed in the work of an event manager as the big day looms.

There was plenty of practical activities, collaboration and encouragement of ideas to get you thinking about all types and aspects of events.\"\n\n\n\"Overall, I found the whole Bootcamp experience was thoroughly enjoyable. The best part for me was when we left the classroom and were able to put the theory into practice in the various ways made available to us. This is what really brought the learnings home for me and allowed me a deeper understanding of the industry.

                "text": "\n\n\nBeaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "\n\n\nBeaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "\n\n\nBeaumaris Theatre Inc. is thrilled to present auditions for our August production of\u00a0Pillow Talk.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillow Talk\u00a0is a tragic comedy about life, love and the promises we make. Written specifically for community theatre, this show calls for a strong and dedicated cast capable of nuancing characters with a light comic touch combined with sincerity in the darker moments.\u00a0\nIn act one we follow the development of our leading couple, Henrietta and Harry, who have stolen an illicit week together, escaping the monotony of their respective marriages to find passion and eventually love in each other's arms.\u00a0\nAct two sees them happily married with grown-up children but facing an uncertain medical future. Visits from Cassie, their daughter and Justin, Henrietta's son from her previous marriage, complicate the family dynamic. The play references the Victorian Assisted Dying legislation, the choices we have and the meaning of love.\nAudition Dates\nSaturday 25 May 10am - 2pmIf you are auditioning for two roles, please book two spots.Call-backs by invitation held Sunday 26 May.\nFor audition queries please contact us at info@beaumaristheatre.com.au\nCharactersYoung Henrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 30 something\nHenri is a young professional woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She appears forward and demanding, particularly in her relationship with Harry, a work colleague with whom she is having an affair. Henri wants passion and excitement back in her life and is not afraid to demand it.\nThis role could be doubled with Cassie. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\nHenrietta (Henri)\u00a0- 60 something\nThirty years on, Henri has lost none of her confidence or outspoken nature. She and Harry have married and have a daughter. With Henri apparently in charge, she and Harry are ridiculously happy until the seriousness of her medical condition begins to undermine her view of herself and her relationships.\u00a0\nThe second half of the play chronicles Henri's physical and mental decline. The actor will play a significant number of scenes propped up in a hospital bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCassie\u00a0- 25 years old\nOn the surface, Cassie is a self-absorbed and materialistic young person for whom her mother's illness is a minor inconvenience. There are opportunities for playing the comedic side of Cassie, however, the actor will need to be able to show a deeper and more interesting side of her character including an emerging maturity and strength.\nThis role could be doubled with Young Henrietta. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nYoung Harry -\u00a030 something\nThe young Harry is quiet, intellectually sharp but no match for the bold and outspoken Henrietta. He is married, but not in love with his wife of six years. He feels responsible for his wife and is conflicted by his developing passion for Henrietta. Harry has a quiet inner strength.\nAs an amateur musician, Harry is seen trying to compose a song for his new love. The ability to strum three chords on a guitar would be an added advantage but is not essential.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Justin. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\u00a0\nHarry -\u00a060 something\nHarry retains his quiet and stoic character. Over time he has given away much to pursue his passion for Henri. He has left his wife and ceased to practice his faith. He cares deeply about his family and manages the conflict between his wife and daughter. he is devoted to Henri and wants to protect her from the world.\u00a0\nHarry carries the final dramatic moments of the play in which the audience should be convinced that he is about to end his wife's suffering by killing her. It is a particularly poignant moment and will call for particular conviction from the actor.\u00a0\nJustin -\u00a0late thirties\u00a0\nJustin is Henrietta's son from her first marriage. He is a member of the Parliament of Victoria and working on a second Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill. He has many of the characteristics of a modern politician. He has a smooth talking, easy way with people but one is never quite sure of the depth of his sincerity.\u00a0\nThis role could be doubled with Young Harry. If you would like to be considered for both roles, please book two audition spots.\n\n\n\n",
