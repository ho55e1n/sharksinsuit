The menu is primarily white rice. A full ingredient list will be provided on the day.\u00a0 \nBruised Food: a Living Laboratory is a project curated by Marnie Badham and Francis Maravillas that complements the exhibition Bruised: Art Action & Ecology in Asia at RMIT Gallery (12 April - 1 June). The Bruised Food Lab Events critically reflects on food and social practice, and present works and events by artists.\nAbout the event\nAs one of the world\u2019s major food crops and staple food,\u00a0rice is unique in the extent and variety of its uses and its shaping of societies and cultures, particularly in Asia. \nSignificantly, the politics and economics of rice in the region have been transformed by processes of globalisation, new agricultural practices and technologies as well as changing diets and tastes. At the same time, the ecology of rice is embedded in established food and socio-cultural systems that are at once local and traditional. \nBuilding on earlier works that explores the politics of rice in the context of Indonesia\u2019s political economy (Hunger Inc) and colonial history (Rijstaffel: The Flamboyant Table) this project presents a series of reflections on significance of rice in the context of the Asian diaspora in Australia. \nAbout the artist\nElia Nurvista is a young Indonesian artist whose practice focuses on food production and distribution and its broader social and historical implications. \nFood in various forms \u2014 from the planting of crops, to the act of eating and the sharing of recipes \u2014 are Nurvista\u2019s entry point to exploring issues of economics, labour, politics, culture and gender. Her practice is also concerned with the intersection between food and commodities, and their relationship to colonialism, economic and political power, and status. \nShe runs Bakudapan, a food study group that undertakes community and research projects, and her social research forms the background of her individual projects, presented through mixed media installations, food workshops and group discussion. \nHer previous installations use a range of materials from crystalline sugar sculptures to sacks of rice, often incorporating video or mural painting and an element of audience interaction.\nImage:\u00a0\nAs Long We Can Import it, Why Bothered Planting? 2015, Elia Nurvista Installation (100 sacks of rice, print on cardboard, lighting and rice, silkscreen and embroidery on canvas), \"High Water Exhibition\", Fukutake House, Shodosima, Japan.

The requirement to pass the WIT ensures that only those hunters able to demonstrate adequate waterfowl identification skills are permitted to hunt game ducks in Victoria. This helps reduce the number of protected non-game species shot by mistake.\r\nTest preparation\r\nIt is advisable that applicants study before the test, otherwise you will not be able to pass the WIT.\r\nThe best way to prepare is to view the Duck Wise education video for free which can be found on the GMA\u2019s website (http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/education/duck-wise)\r\nOnce you feel you are confident in identifying waterbirds you should complete the free online practice test which allows you to familiarise yourself with the testing procedure (http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/Licensing/apply-for-a-game-licence/waterfowl-identification-test/waterfowl-identification-practice-test)\r\nTest attendance\r\nThere is no refund for applicants who do not attend the test they are booked into. The applicant will need to book into another test and pay a new fee to sit the test on another date.\r\nIf you can not attend the test date you have booked into you will need to notify the GMA (Contact the GMA)\u00a0prior to the test date in order to move your test date or obtain a refund.\r\nWhat does the test involve?\r\nThe test consists of 22 multiple-choice questions. Including ID checks and discussions, the test takes approximately 45 minutes. The test is viewed on a TV Screen and the procedure is explained by an example prior to the actual test. A species of waterfowl is viewed for approximately five seconds and applicants have 20 seconds to select an answer and prepare for the next question.\r\nA practice test is available online which allows you to familiarise yourself with the testing procedure (http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/Licensing/apply-for-a-game-licence/waterfowl-identification-test/waterfowl-identification-practice-test)\r\nThe test examines a hunter\u2019s ability to identify species of waterfowl and determine whether they may be hunted.\r\nDuring the test hunters must remain silent and seated until the video has concluded. Any applicant who speaks or copies someone else\u2019s answers during the test will be required to leave the room and will have to re-apply to sit the test again.\r\nOnly applicants are allowed in the testing room while the test is in progress, friends and relatives must wait outside.\r\nWhat do I need to bring?\r\nPhoto identification (like a driver\u2019s or shooter\u2019s licence) must be presented at the test session. If the applicant doesn\u2019t bring photo identification they can not sit the test. \r\nYou need to be at least 10 years old to sit the WIT. Applicant\u2019s under 18 who do not have photo ID need to bring along a copy of a birth certificate or birth extract.\r\nWhen do I get my results?\r\nTest results are sent out in the mail to applicants within 10 working days from the test date. Applicants who pass the test receive a Certificate of Proficiency.\r\nA score of 85% or greater constitutes a pass, provided that the applicant also correctly identifies\u00a0all\u00a0the non-game sequences.\r\nFurther information\r\nFor further information on the WIT please visit GMA\u2019s website at http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/\r\n\u00a0",

Australia Day asks the questions that have to be asked, that no else seems to be asking. Who are we? What is our country? How do we move forward from here? \nAs Stan has written, \u201cAs uncomfortable as it is, we need to reckon with our history. On January 26, no Australian can really look away\u201d. Australia Day is a sad, wise, beautiful, reflective and troubled book, about who we are as a nation, about the indigenous struggle for belonging and identity in Australia, and what it means to be Australian.\nTalking to My Country is \u201ca story so essential and salutary to this place that it should be given out free at the ballot box\u201d. The Australian\nStan Grant is a Wiradjuri and Kamilaroi man. A journalist since 1987, he has worked for the ABC, SBS, CNN, the Seven Network and Sky News Australia. In 2015 Talking to My Country won the Walkley Book Award and Stan also won a Walkley Award for his coverage of Indigenous affairs. In 2016 he was appointed to the Referendum Council on Indigenous Recognition. Stan is now Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University and International Affairs Analyst at ABC.\nMark Kenny was appointed Senior Fellow at the Australian Studies Institute ANU in January 2019 after a high-profile journalistic career culminating in six years as chief political correspondent and national affairs editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The Canberra Times. He is a regular on the ABC's Insiders program, Sky News Agenda, and radio programs across the country.\nBook signings at before and after the event by Harry Hartog Bookshop. Stan will also be signing copies of On Identity. Tribalism, nationalism and sectarianism are dividing the world into us and them. Communities are a tinderbox of anger and resentment. Stan argues that it is time to leave identity behind and to embrace cosmopolitanism. On Identity is a meditation on hope and community.\n\u00a0",

On January 26, no Australian can really look away\u201d. <I>Australia Day</I> is a sad, wise, beautiful, reflective and troubled book, about who we are as a nation, about the indigenous struggle for belonging and identity in Australia, and what it means to be Australian.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"xmsonormal\"><SPAN></SPAN><I>Talking to My Country</I> is \u201ca story so essential and salutary to this place that it should be given out free at the ballot box\u201d. <I>The Australian</I></P>\n<P CLASS=\"xmsonormal\"><SPAN><STRONG>Stan Grant</STRONG> is a Wiradjuri and Kamilaroi man. A journalist since 1987, he has worked for the ABC, SBS,</SPAN><SPAN> CNN,</SPAN><SPAN> the Seven Network and Sky News Australia. In 2015 <I>Talking to My Country</I> won the Walkley Book Award and Stan also won a Walkley Award for his coverage of Indigenous affairs.

Stan is now Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University and International Affairs Analyst at ABC.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"xmsonormal\"><STRONG>Mark Kenny</STRONG> was appointed Senior Fellow at the Australian Studies Institute ANU in January 2019 after a high-profile journalistic career culminating in six years as chief political correspondent and national affairs editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The Canberra Times. He is a regular on the ABC's Insiders program, Sky News Agenda, and radio programs across the country.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"xmsonormal\">Book signings at before and after the event by Harry Hartog Bookshop. Stan will also be signing copies of <I>On Identity</I>. Tribalism, nationalism and sectarianism are dividing the world into us and them. Communities are a tinderbox of anger and resentment. Stan argues that it is time to leave identity behind and to embrace cosmopolitanism. On Identity is a meditation on hope and community.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>\u00a0</STRONG></P>"
