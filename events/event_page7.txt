It also allows\u00a0Transport Canberra\u00a0to effectively manage customer demand for bus services and ensures that bus resources are used efficiently. \r\nTo register, choose a location you wish to board the bus from and select how many passengers are in your party. On the day, passengers will need to present their ticket(s) in either electronic or paper form to Transport Canberra staff.\r\nBy Registering to Ride you are selecting to ride with\u00a0Transport Canberra buses, which includes seated and standing positions on the bus. Please note that passengers are not guaranteed a seat for travel. Bus services to the National Ceremony are limited and we strongly encourage booking early. \u00a0\r\nAs Anzac Day is a public holiday,\u00a0Transport Canberra\u00a0will be operating on a public holiday timetable for regular services throughout the day.

Transport Canberra, together with the Australian War Memorial, provides free bus services to assist in reducing these pressures.\u00a0Transport Canberra\u00a0has implemented a registration process to assist in gauging expected attendance and assist passengers in preparing for their travels.\u00a0\r\nDoes registering to ride guarantee me a seat on the bus?\r\nBy registering to ride passengers are selecting to ride with\u00a0Transport Canberra\u00a0buses to the Anzac Day Dawn Service and National Ceremony. This includes both seated and standing positions on the bus. \r\nIs Register to Ride only for the Anzac Day National Ceremony?\r\nNo. If passengers are considering attending either the National Ceremony or the Dawn Service, they will need to Register to Ride. If passengers are intending on going to both ceremonies they will need to register separately. Please note that services will not run from the major bus stations for the National Ceremony.\r\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\r\nOn the day, passengers will need to arrive 10 - 15 minutes prior to departure and present their printed or electronic ticket to\u00a0Transport Canberra\u00a0at the selected event pick up location.\r\nAre tickets to the event unlimited?\r\nBus services to the Anzac Day Dawn National Service and National Ceremony are limited.

Tickets are not transferrable for other locations/times. \r\nIs there a limit on how many tickets an individual can Register to Ride to either service?\r\nPassengers are able to Register to Ride for up to 10 tickets in any single registration for either ceremony.\r\nWhat if I don\u2019t have access to the internet to register?\r\nContact 13 17 10 and you will be registered over the phone. A copy of the ticket/s will be sent to your nominated mailing address. \r\nWhat if I arrive on the day without registering?\r\nTransport Canberra cannot guarantee that there will be available space to board the bus if passengers have not registered to use the free service. If there is no room to board passengers will need to make alternative arrangements. We strongly recommend booking early.\r\nWho can I contact if I have further questions?\r\nContact our Customer Service Team on 13 17 10 or email actionmarketing@act.gov.au\r\n",

This rolling practice on the yoga tune up balls has invited me to experience parts of my body like never before, my spatial awareness (that\u00a0 is awareness of my body in space and body part in relationship with body part and in relationship with breath) has significantly enhanced my physical and mindfulness practices in yoga (finding different range & mobility even after 10yrs of practice as well as heightened awareness) and other movements which translates to life off the mat and I am so inspired to share this practice.\u201d\n\nLEE-ANNE HERON, ND\u00a0 ERYT, Yoga Alliance Expert Teacher Designation, YACEP\nBSc (Nat), Adv Dip Herb Med, Adv Dip Hom, NKT, over 1000 hours Yoga TT and Body Work Certificates\nFunctional Anatomy Teacher Trainer, Yin Yoga Teacher Trainer, The Roll Model\u00ae Method & Yoga Tune Up\u00ae Teacher Trainer\nDirector of Training Yoga Training Australia www.facebook.com/yogatrainingaustralia\n\u00a0\nLee is based in Perth, Australia and enjoys delivering workshops, teacher trainings and retreats worldwide as well as providing CPE for allied health industry at university campuses, health clinics and birthing centres and is on faculty for International Yoga Teaching Trainings as expert Anatomy & Physiology teacher and Yin Yoga Teacher Trainer.
