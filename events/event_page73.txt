Through attention to this media and its philosophical and political-economic frames, our project seeks to analyse the emergence of contemporary Western European \u2018Identitarian\u2019 movements in comparison with recently active \u2018Patriot\u2019 collectives in Australia.\u00a0\nThis investigation begins from the premise that European Identitarian movements are influenced by ethno-cultural canons of the Nouvelle Droite (or European \u2018New Right\u2019), in addition to the Eurasianist philosophy of Alexandr Dugin. Australian Patriot individuals and organisations, on the other hand, are proposed to draw inspiration from avowedly National Socialist authors and the politicking and propagandising of Adolf Hitler himself. We then consider that Australian entities\u2019 extreme social conservativism and ethnicity-related xenophobia may be underwritten by a desire to return to a pre-neoliberal political-economic environment similar to Atlantic Fordism; excluding the explicit endorsement of high unionisation and progressive tax rates. From a comparative perspective, the political economy of Identitarianism is explored for its embrace of capitalism and commodification, including through Identitarians\u2019 promotion of international trade and sale of merchandise. \n\nSpeaker bio\nImogen is a lecturer in criminology at Deakin University and member of the Alfred Deakin Research Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation, researching in the areas of social media, extremism, counter/terrorism, and public criminology.

Recently, students globally have made their mark in the climate change community, by challenging our political leaders and ensuring that their voices are heard. How can we translate this passion into our teaching practices?\nPodcasting is a valuable tool to reach local and global audiences.

Too often, technology is perceived to be at odds with conservation.
