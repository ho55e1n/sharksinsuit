If you have any issues, please email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer\u00a0with the details.\nCan I transfer my ticket to another session?\nIf you have a Single Session ticket, you can change your session by logging onto your Eventbrite account and under \u2018Tickets\u2019 clicking the transfer icon. For more details on how to do this please visit the\u00a0transfer information page. Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.\nBeer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.\nI\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?\nUnfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.\nCan I give my ticket to someone else?\nIf you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.\nCan people under 18 attend?\nIn Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.\nWhat happens when I get there?\nOn arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in. Season Pass ticket holders will be given Season Pass accreditation, which must be shown when entering each session.\nPlease be prepared to show your valid ID. Please note all bags are subject to inspection at any point during the event. Bottles, cans, glass, food, drink, alcohol, illicit drugs, illegal substances, fireworks, explosives or anything that can be used as a weapon cannot be brought into the festival.\nAs you enter, you\u2019ll be given a Festival Glass and your Official GABS Guide. And then you\u2019re good to go!\nI have applied to be a volunteer. Do I need to purchase a ticket?\nGreat work. We love our volunteers! All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).\nWill tickets sell out?\nThe majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.\nWhat if I don\u2019t have proof of age?\nGABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.\nWhen do the bars close?\nAll bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.\nWhat sort of behaviour is unacceptable?\nIf anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.\nI have a question that\u2019s not answered here.\nPlease read through the GABS\u00a0website\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there. Alternatively, please feel free to message us on Facebook or email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer.\nPlease note that by purchasing a ticket to GABS 2019, you consent to any photos of you at the event to be used for future marketing purposes.

Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.</P>\n<P>Beer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Unfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can I give my ticket to someone else?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can people under 18 attend?</STRONG></P>\n<P>In Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What happens when I get there?</STRONG></P>\n<P>On arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in. Season Pass ticket holders will be given Season Pass accreditation, which must be shown when entering each session.</P>\n<P>Please be prepared to show your valid ID. Please note all bags are subject to inspection at any point during the event.

And then you\u2019re good to go!</P>\n<P><STRONG>I have applied to be a volunteer. Do I need to purchase a ticket?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Great work. We love our volunteers! All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).</P>\n<P><STRONG>Will tickets sell out?</STRONG></P>\n<P>The majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What if I don\u2019t have proof of age?</STRONG></P>\n<P>GABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.</P>\n<P><STRONG>When do the bars close?</STRONG></P>\n<P>All bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What sort of behaviour is unacceptable?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I have a question that\u2019s not answered here.</STRONG></P>\n<P>Please read through the GABS\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.gabsfestival.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">website</A>\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there.

When this awakens in us, we can connect with our true purpose here. It aligns our base, our heart and our higher senses as an integrated expression of our power and our light. Yes, sexuality and consciousness flows naturally and beautifully together. Perhaps it\u2019s as simple as reframing what orgasm is, and granting permission finally, to open to this kind of ease and flow. This can break down the need for that ego-driven state of play, the drama and the addictions, that hook us in our modern world.\nThis evening presentation captures a longing that is rarely addressed in our 3D world.\nTonight Stephanie guides us through a deeper, more integrated way of being, once we have shed the constrictions that hold us in our habitual patterns.\n\u2022 Awaken orgasmic pathways\u2022 Step beyond shut down and disconnection\u2022 3 simple steps to body bliss\nWhen we were small we created patterns for survival that now as adults, no longer serve us as we seek a richer, more meaningful life. These stories limit our ability to create in the world, limit our intimacy in relating, and limit our pleasure. We are orgasmic beings, and it was a learned response to shut that down. Here, we drop the constriction and the self-talk that shuts down this vital essence within us. Here we claim back our power and our beauty. Here we drop the stories, and reset our reality for more love and freedom.\nWe cover:\u2013 How we disconnected from our vital force\u2013 Simple steps to access this body bliss\u2013 Learn a process for releasing blocks and moving energy\u2013 Witness the demonstration\u2013 Culminate with a beautiful and powerful visualisation to reset your alignment with orgasmic flow.\nWe are waking up at last!

                "text": "Rhythm & Movement for EvolutionMelbourne TaKeTiNa Retreat with Michael Kokinos & Ria SoemardjoMelbourne May 17 \u2013 19, 2019TaKeTiNa is a transformational group process, working with the powerful tools of poly-rhythm, voice, movement, and somatic awareness. Sometimes referred to as the Yoga of Rhythm, TaKeTiNa invites participants into a state of profound stillness, awareness, joy, and connection.\n\nWe are excited to offer this full weekend retreat (non-residential) at one of Melbourne\u2019s most peaceful and beautiful venues, The Michael Centre in Warranwood. An opportunity to immerse yourself in an enlivening group process, we will work with the theme of finding balance, flow and integration even when navigating significant chaos, whether internal or external. At this time in history we are facing unprecedented chaos and over-stimulation in the world around us and in our busy lives. When left unchecked, this can easily lead to states of overwhelm, anxiety, disconnection, and low vitality. The retreat will be a space for deep rest, healing and revitalization as we drop into a profound experience of primordial rhythm.\nNo musical experience is necessary and participants are invited to journey at their own pace within this safely held and dynamic group process. Participation in TaKeTiNa leads to a perceptive state which can be described as \u2018simultaneous awareness\u2019. Poly-rhythm has been used for millennia among all cultures as a tool for healing, celebrating, and evolving our true nature. TaKeTiNa is used today in diverse fields as music education, therapy, meditation, peak performance, and personal growth.\n\nAbout TaKeTiNa Rhythm Process:\nFor a brief video intro to TaKeTiNa watch:\u00a0https://youtu.be/Inr0coWTYlA\n\nIn your daily life, TaKeTiNa can help you to:\n\n- experience a profound state of peace, relaxation and inner silence\n- connect with your innate vitality\n- increase your physical, emotional, and mental resilience\n- manage chaotic or challenging life situations with creativity, humour and effectiveness\n- decrease your anxiety about making mistakes and always getting things right\nFor more information about TaKeTiNa, visit\u00a0www.taketina.com\n\nWhen: 17 \u2013 19 May 2019\nFriday evening intro 7 \u2013 9PMSaturday 10AM \u2013 5PMSunday 10AM \u2013 5PM\n\nVenue:\u00a0The Michael Centre, 37a Wellington Park Drive, Warranwood, Vic 3134\n\nTickets:\nFull Weekend: $285 / $255 Concession\nEarly Bird: $245 / $225 Concession (until 30 April)\nFriday night only: $25\n\nFacilitated by: Michael Kokinos with Ria Soemardjo\nOrganiser: Andy Harrison, 0417 561 473,\u00a0hello@melbournepiano.com.au\nTransport & Parking\nParking is available on-site.\nRideshare Board:\u00a0https://bit.ly/2rwWJ2r\nIf you are able to offer a ride or need a ride, please enter your details on this private rideshare board.

He combines experience as a studio musician with deep knowledge of the role of rhythmic intelligence in somatic health.\nHis background as a physiotherapist includes over 20 years developing methods for awareness, perception and movement of the body : The TaKeTiNa process is unique as an opportunity for deep embodiment and a space to explore the connection between consciousness and soma.\nMichael also has a strong connection to Arnhem Land people with 12 years working with NT Indigenous community organisations. He works closely with Steiner schools specialising in rhythm and movement for education and wellbeing. He is the founder of NT clinic Blue Sky Therapies, holds a masters degree in health management and works all over Australia and internationally.\u00a0www.blueskytherapies.com.au\n\nRia Soemardjo is a Melbourne based musician with a passion for collaborating with artists across diverse range of genres and artforms. Her distinct, haunting vocal style reflects her Australian/Indonesian cultural heritage and she draws on her love for Balinese and Javanese musical traditions in her song writing and collaborative projects.\n\nA fascination for exploring voice and movement lead her to train as an Alexander Technique teacher, and she taught at the School for FM Alexander Studies for several years, with a focus on the practical application of this approach for voice and performance. In 2018, she will complete her training in a cutting edge approach to rhythm/voice training - Taketina Rhythm Process, and share this work through group workshops.\n\nRia's most recent performance 'The Echoes Project' in Chinatown for 2017 Mapping Melbourne festival, reflects her ongoing interest in developing contemporary performance/rituals, in response to urban sites. Ria has received Green Room nominations for her compositions and live music performance for dance works\u2013 including Enfold (2016) and Opal Vapour (2013) \u2013 and an award with Helen Mountfort for \u2018Tower Suites\u2019(2012), with dancer Ros Warby. She has recorded with many ensembles including original compositions with her contemporary world music trio 'Fine Blue Thread' which melds tabla, cello, viola and voice and continues to learn and perform different styles of gamelan and percussion from Indonesia.www.riavoice.com\n\nAbout the Organiser:\nAndy Harrison has been involved in TaKeTiNa Rhythm Process since 1999 and is passionate to share this unique work with community in Melbourne. He is Director of Melbourne Piano School.\nwww.melbournepiano.com.au\n\nAbout the Venue:\nSituated in a tranquil bush setting in Warranwood, the Michael Centre was designed by renowned Australian architect, Greg Burgess. Our workshop takes place in the beautiful pentagonal Movement Room. The venue provides the perfect setting for TaKeTiNa journeys and is a comfortable heated space. A kitchen is available for use during lunch.\n\n\"Rhythm is one of the most ancient and efficient ways to influence and develop human consciousness. In our globally-networked and technologically-focussed world, human beings often lose touch with their own internal rhythms, making them feel displaced and de-synchronized. TaKeTiNa allows them to reconnect with the healing powers of rhythm and primordial motion. Social, mental, creative, spiritual and of course musical faculties are reawakened and developed with the practice of TaKeTiNa.\"\n- Reinhard Flatischler (Founder of the TaKeTiNa Process)",

                "text": "\n\n\nWomen, it's our regular fortnightly circle but this April it's on steroids....... Because I love you.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA night of nourishment, connection, chocolate, and dance to honour the rise of the Divine Feminine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\n\nAll over the world women have again started to regather. This night we honour that. Together we will drink cacao, shed old, stagnant, unhelpful ways of being, and then dance so wildly that we shatter glass ceilings. \n\n\n\n\n\n-------OUTLINE OF THE EVENING--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728Cacao Ceremony\u2728\n\n\nWe will start with a ceremonial cacao ritual. The cacao will be a union of ceremonial grade cacao from Guatemala and from Bali. From this pure form it is mixed with boiling water into a delicious, rich, warming drink. Cacao is a powerful superfood, containing nutrients like Magnesium, Zinc, Calcium and Iron. But the real power of cacao is in its energetic ability to take us out of the mind, and drop us into our hearts and our bodies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728Women's Circle\u2728\n\n\nWe will follow the cacao with a women's circle. You are invited to share as little or as deeply as you wish. The circle is a safe space to be seen, heard, and loved in your vulnerability and your authenticity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728Ecstatic Dance\u2728\n\n\nFollowing this, Bethany will guide us into an hour of ecstatic dance! You are welcome to dance, not dance, sit, meditate, yell, cry, laugh- all is welcome! The purpose of ecstatic dance is to abandon yourself, to lose yourself completely within movement. You move freely to the rhythm in any way you feel. This can often lead into a trance-like state and feelings of ecstasy. Cacao will assist you into moving into these states more easily.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE, SISTERS!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nThis event is open to all those identifying as female. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728LOCATION\u2728\n\n\nBrunswick Neighbourhood House\n\n\n43A De Carle St, Brunswick VIC 3056\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728DATE AND TIME\u2728\n\n\nWednesday, April 17th.\n\n\n Arrive 7pm and approximate closing at 10pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728ENERGY EXCHANGE\u2728\n\n\nPre-sale: $33 \n\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/women-who-circle-with-the-full-moon-brunswick-tickets-50567114601\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor Sale: $38 cash or card. \n\n\n\n\n\nBank transfer\n\n\nACC NAME: Earth is a She\n\n\nBSB: 944600\n\n\nACC NO: 000643405\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nAbout your facilitators:\n\n\nSophia Leone is the creator behind Earth is a She- an organisation that aims to bring together sacred women\u2019s work with Earth healing.

Cacao will assist you into moving into these states more easily.</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE, SISTERS!</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>-------------------</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>This event is open to all those identifying as female. </SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>\u2728LOCATION\u2728</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Brunswick Neighbourhood House</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>43A De Carle St, Brunswick VIC 3056</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>\u2728DATE AND TIME\u2728</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Wednesday, April 17th.</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN> Arrive 7pm and approximate closing at 10pm.</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>\u2728ENERGY EXCHANGE\u2728</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Pre-sale: $33 </SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/women-who-circle-with-the-full-moon-brunswick-tickets-50567114601</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Door Sale: $38 cash or card. </SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Bank transfer</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>ACC NAME: Earth is a She</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>BSB: 944600</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>ACC NO: 000643405</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN><BR></SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>-----------------------</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>About your facilitators:</SPAN></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"_1mf _1mj\"><SPAN>Sophia Leone is the creator behind Earth is a She- an organisation that aims to bring together sacred women\u2019s work with Earth healing.

With the far surf coast of NSW in their DNA, this now Melbourne based group know how to get a room jumping with their brand of garage rock riffage (so chunky it found the group supporting their heroes Hockey Dad across the East Coast).<BR></P>\n<P>Gosh won the coveted Triple J Unearthed competition to perform at 2018\u2019s Yours &amp; Owls Festival. They\u2019ll be dragging their brand of heartstring pullin\u2019 indie-rock anthems from the \u2018gong down to Melbourne to promote their new single \u201cNever Lose You\u201d. There\u2019s a variety of potential ways they\u2019ll do this, they could catch a train to Sydney then fly to Melbourne, catch the bus to Canberra and fly down or simply drive the estimated 8.5 hour journey. Let\u2019s find out. X</P>\n<P>And unlike most band rooms, Yah Yah's is open 'til 5AM so you can kick on and party for no extra charge!

The yoga posture practice is optional for those who prefer to only do the meditation sitting practices.\nWe hope these monthly one day urban retreats will build a community of fellow-travellers on the path of deep, authentic practice.
