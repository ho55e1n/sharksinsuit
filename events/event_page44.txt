Despite being very popular, not many engineers know this topic in details and its knowledge is very limited to a few sub-contractors which generally do Design & Construction. So having this skill will help you to deal with PT contractors confidently and not only review their work but also start doing design yourself.\u00a0\n\nYou will be working on an actual project and have a chance to create runs and model using the design program yourself, at the end, you will be given a certificate of attendance which you can also claim your CPD hrs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAGENDA & SCHEDULE\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind below for course schedule:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESENTER\n\nThis workshop will be presented by Aaron, director of TeleTraining.\u00a0Aaron is highly experienced as a Structural Design\u00a0Engineer and Educator in construction industry. He graduated with a Masters in Structural Engineering from UNSW and has 8 years of professional experience as a structural engineer, designing for industry leaders including Westfield and Meriton.\n\u00a0His educational courses combined with live case studies and workshop activities are highly welcomed by leading companies in the construction industry including Lendlease, Buildcorp and Probuild.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER BENEFIT\n\n\nPrivate Course\n- This course is very private class with around 6 people\n\nLaptop & Program\u00a0\n- Laptop and program is provided for full\nSupplementary Online Course for Self-study\u00a0\n- Supplementary online courses are provided\n\n\n\nCPD Hours Claim Available\n- You can claim your Continuous Professional Development Hours\n\nCertificate To Be Given\n- We provide the certificate so that you can use it in your CV/Resume\n\nOnline Course Discount\n- Even after the workshop, you can practice and review the workshop again if you need. Discount coupon will be provided.\n\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS ATTENDEE's TESTIMONIALS\n\n\n\nGisele Structural Design Engineer in TTW\n\n\u201cI highly recommend TeleTraining.The RAPT workshop I attended was very practical. It is a must for any structural engineer willing to be engaged in Post Tensioning design, especially for newcomers to Australia, as the course explains how to use the program as well as to understanding the local standards requirements.\"\u00a0\n\n\nPooria Structural Design Engineer in Robert Bird Group\n\n\u201cI had a course in PT design with TeleTraining. It was a full practical and hands-on course with professional presenter. I strongly recommend TeleTraining to whom wants to grow their knowledge in their profession.\u201d\n\n\nFarial Structural Design Engineer in Eclipse Consulting\n\n\"I was impressed by the hand on practical approach \u2013 where I got to work through a real project sizing up PT slabs and beams. The course not only gave me a good understanding of the critical features within RAPT but also added to my overall structural knowledge of PT concrete design.\u201d\n\n\nAzadeh Structural Design Engineer in Enstruct\n\n\"TeleTraining\u2019s course helped me a lot to understand RC/PT concrete design\nin a very short time. I could learn real engineering practice by a senior engineer. Also, I watched online course for further practice & self-study. I highly recommend TeleTraining to anybody who wants to get concrete design knowledge and RAPT usage quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADMISSION\n\n\n. Installment payments available.

Skills like empathy, motivation, self-regulation and self-awareness all require emotional intelligence. These are skills which help us face challenging behaviours, but for us to successfully teach these skills to children it is imperative that we understand them. \nYou will have the opportunity to think differently & explore emotional intelligence, through presentations by: \nAnthony Semann is primarily a presenter and researcher. His ability to deliver inspirational conference key notes and facilitate innovative and transformative professional development programs is renowned. His background is in education, research and management \u2013 in government, corporate and community-based organisations.\u00a0Anthony\u2019s expertise as a researcher and his specialist knowledge of early education has seen him work across Australia, Asia, Europe, America, France and New Zealand. He has delivered hundreds of key notes and papers at conferences and over 15,000 professional development programs over the last 20 years.\u00a0Anthony challenges organisations and people. He asks them to reflect. To ask how their communication, their leadership, their values, their relationships and their workplace culture and diversity affect what they do. He asks them to reflect because it is these things that affect their services, businesses and ultimately the community. \nKey Note: Unlocking your potential through great consciousness\u00a0is the key to success the ability to develop greater\u00a0consciousness\u00a0of yourself and others? How might we begin to develop this in the early years sector and what in fact are we trying to unlock? The goal at hand is to develop better human connections, the ability to suspend what we think we know in order to learn what we need, as well as the commitment to going learning and development. This keynote will provide the opportunity to delve into the world of emotional intelligence.\nAngela North is a registered psychologist and play therapist of 20 years\u2019 experience, working with parents and their children in clinical, community and educational settings. Angela's current roles include Senior Psychologist at the Cheshire School, a specialised primary school for children with significant social, emotional and behavioural problems. Angela has helped develop the Cheshire Toolkit, an online program for early childhood educators to foster social-emotional skills in the pre-school classroom. Utilising play therapy and parent-child (filial) therapy, Angela supports children to recover from trauma and grief, to develop resilience, enhance family relationships and adjust to new social circumstances in positive ways.\n In Angela's lecture you will learn to define trauma, understand what underpins emotional intelligence, and what play therapists do to help. You will have opportunities to reflect on your work with children, and how your own history and family culture informs your work and life. Most importantly, Angela brings all this information together with practical tips, techniques, videos and resources for further learning. These are designed to help you recognise your own strengths, and how you can best support children in developing emotional intelligence and a strong sense of self.\nColin Slattery is primarily a leadership coach and change facilitator. He specialises in organisational development, group facilitation, personal development, coaching, psychometric assessment, leadership assessment, leadership training and community engagement.\u00a0Colin is in high demand to coach and mentor employees, especially in change management situations because of his experience as a senior executive with government agencies and in large non-government organisations. And because of his compassion, his warmth and his capacity to discern quickly.\u00a0Colin pushes clients to do better. To understand why their staff, work in the ways they do and to ask if that knowledge can be used to assist them to go further, do better and perform in the best way possible. He creates knowledge within organisations to improve organisations. \nEmotional intelligence the key to success. Emotional intelligence has been seen as one of the keys to success both professional and personally. And it is through both assessing and then planning for action based on our assessment of our emotional intelligence that the real magic happens. In this workshop we will explore the world of emotional intelligence and how we can grow this in order to become more connected and more responsive colleagues, friends and partners.",

The goal at hand is to develop better human connections, the ability to suspend what we think we know in order to learn what we need, as well as the commitment to going learning and development. This keynote will provide the opportunity to delve into the world of emotional intelligence.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><SPAN>Angela North</SPAN><SPAN> is a registered psychologist and play therapist of 20 years\u2019 experience, working with parents and their children in clinical, community and educational settings. Angela's current roles include Senior Psychologist at the Cheshire School, a specialised primary school for children with significant social, emotional and behavioural problems. Angela has helped develop the Cheshire Toolkit, an online program for early childhood educators to foster social-emotional skills in the pre-school classroom. Utilising play therapy and parent-child (filial) therapy, Angela supports children to recover from trauma and grief, to develop resilience, enhance family relationships and adjust to new social circumstances in positive ways.</SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN> In Angela's lecture you will learn to define trauma, understand what underpins emotional intelligence, and what play therapists do to help. You will have opportunities to reflect on your work with children, and how your own history and family culture informs your work and life. Most importantly, Angela brings all this information together with practical tips, techniques, videos and resources for further learning. These are designed to help you recognise your own strengths, and how you can best support children in developing emotional intelligence and a strong sense of self.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Colin Slattery</SPAN><SPAN> is primarily a leadership coach and change facilitator. He specialises in organisational development, group facilitation, personal development, coaching, psychometric assessment, leadership assessment, leadership training and community engagement.\u00a0Colin is in high demand to coach and mentor employees, especially in change management situations because of his experience as a senior executive with government agencies and in large non-government organisations. And because of his compassion, his warmth and his capacity to discern quickly.\u00a0Colin pushes clients to do better. To understand why their staff, work in the ways they do and to ask if that knowledge can be used to assist them to go further, do better and perform in the best way possible. He creates knowledge within organisations to improve organisations</SPAN><SPAN>. </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Emotional intelligence the key to success. Emotional intelligence has been seen as one of the keys to success both professional and personally. And it is through both assessing and then planning for action based on our assessment of our emotional intelligence that the real magic happens. In this workshop we will explore the world of emotional intelligence and how we can grow this in order to become more connected and more responsive colleagues, friends and partners.<SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>"

NOTE no sessions during the Public Holiday weeks, Easter Monday week and Queens Birthday week.\nAge:\u00a03 and above (attending early years/Kinder Program)\nPrice:\u00a0$15 per child per session, with a 30% discount for siblings. Payable per term in advance.\nAdults and babes-in-arms\u00a0are free, but if you also have toddlers our Bush Playgroup may be a better choice for your family.\u00a0 We\u00a0need you to register for a free ticket so we know who is part of our group.\nFAQ's\nWhy is outdoor play important?\nPlaying outside in nature is great way to get kids moving. We aim to give you time together outside as well as ideas and inspiration for\u00a0playing outside on\u00a0the Surf Coast.\nDo parents have to stay?\nYes. Spending time in nature is good for you too! Our parents have told us that they look forward to Monday mornings just as much as their kids. \u00a0We are a playgroup which means we're not licensed to care for children without parental supervision. You are\u00a0responsible for the safety and supervision of your child.\u00a0\nCan I bring my baby?\nBabes\u00a0in arms are very welcome but the program as age appropriate to excite and extend our 3 years plus age group.\u00a0Dad's and grandparents are welcome too.\u00a0 Our multi-age playgroup is a great space for any walking babies.\nCan I just turn up on the day?\nNo. We need to know who's going to be at each session. We keep our group sizes small as we believe this makes for a better quality experience. It also helps us to keep you safe. Our group sizes are limited to 15 families and we offer bookings on a per term basis.\u00a0 We can arrange a session to try if you contact us in advance.\nWhat if I can't get there every week, or if\u00a0it rains?\nWe play outside in all types of weather. That's part of the fun. The only time we don't play is if the weather is classed as extreme. That might be a day that is forecast to be 33 degrees or over, a code red fire day or galeforce winds. We have a room at Camp that we can use if we need to take shelter or hold the session inside.\nWe know sometimes you just can't\u00a0make it. Kids get sick, they're asleep or it's just not happening. We don't provide refunds for missed sessions but we're happy for you to make it up on another day.",

That's part of the fun. The only time we don't play is if the weather is classed as extreme. That might be a day that is forecast to be 33 degrees or over, a code red fire day or galeforce winds. We have a room at Camp that we can use if we need to take shelter or hold the session inside.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>We know sometimes you just can't\u00a0make it. Kids get sick, they're asleep or it's just not happening. We don't provide refunds for missed sessions but we're happy for you to make it up on another day.</SPAN></P>"

It forms part of the MATES Mentoring Program and the Victorian Government's investment in the local Connecting the Service Puzzle initiative.\nThe training series will cover topics specifically designed to provide positive role models who Mentor, Assist, Target, Engage and enhance the Skills (MATES) and life experiences of young people within our communities.\u00a0\n\nIn session 1, participants will cover the foundational learning necessary to become a Youth Mentor within the MATES Mentoring In-School Program. Particpants will enhance skills to actively build and maintain a mentor relationship, provide an insight into young people and challenges faced, as well as provide engagement tools, techniques and strategies.\u00a0\nSessions 2 & 3 have been designed to provide additional skills and understanding for mentors of young people who may have more significant and complex needs and behaviours such as the young people participating in the Horsham-based youth crime diversion strategy, Connecting the Service Puzzle.\nSession 2 will see participants\u00a0 covering the culture of disadvantage, strengths versus deficits, child abuse, trauma, challenging behaviours and strategies and techniques to support young people. This session also reflects on substance use (alcohol and other drugs) and what is meant by harm reduction.\nIn session 3, participants will be guided through the escalation cycle and aggression along with tools and strategies for de-escalation. We will also touch on suicide and self-harm, and look at the need and strategies for self-care and personal safety. In conclusion, participants will be taken through the stages of planning a mentor relationship and reflect back on the policies and procedures including the code of conduct, incident reporting, resources, and the process of matching.\n\nPlease note:\n* Morning tea is provided. Lunch is\u00a0not\u00a0provided with approximately 30 minutes allocated to break.\u00a0\n**Some information provided can be considered provocative, offensive and may cause emotional distress for some people.
