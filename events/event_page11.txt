In this workshop Jasmine will use the power of sound and vibration to restore harmony and balance to the body and mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nJasmine is an incredibly powerful teacher who is vastly experienced in her depth of knowledge, practice and understanding. She has learnt many different modalities over 25 years and uses all her skills to produce an amazing experience that is not like any other.\n\n\nThe energy that comes through her while using different instruments such as the crystal bowls, gongs, and chanting, is not like anything ive ever personally experienced with anyone else before, leaving you feeling completely energised and relaxed, clearing away any old unharmonised or stuck energy. This is a vastly powerful and transformative experience that leaves you feeling completely in alignment with your best and highest self.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese sound healings can have a profoundly beneficial effect on your body and any ailments you may be suffering from, as well as bringing clarity and positivity back to your thinking, allowing a complete integration and alignment of your body, mind and spiritual connection unified as one. Jasmine's intention is to share wisdom with everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to receive this work through such an experienced teacher. Jasmine is based in Sydney but will arrive in Melbourne for this weekend to offer this powerful journey.

Furthermore, she is the only bilingual Chinese-English therapist with formal qualifications in crystal therapy, sound healing, hypnotism and Reiki. After more than 25 years working in this field, she has created a unique healing style through the combination of Zen, fasting, Chinese medicine, Reki, crystal and sound healing into one coherent system. Believing in the harmony between humankind and heaven, Jasmine uses sound, visual, light and magnetic effects together with Reiki to enable her clients to feel at peace in mind and body.\n\n",

We\u2019re SUPER excited to have three insanely talented artists \u2013 who happen to be three of our favourite people on the planet! \u2013 crossing the border for this HUGE triple header.First up, we have the queen of vibe, Miss Lili Joy. She needs absolutely no introduction and this will be her third occasion representing the harbour city for White Noise. Next, 43 Degrees Records\u2019 co-founder and red hot producer doing amazing things, Hoten. We won\u2019t forget the last time he lifted the roof from the main room at Guerns, so he was an obvious choice to have back. And last, but absolutely not least, we have superstar DJ, avid surfer and all-round gentleman, Sir Robbie Lowe on his way to present his renowned house and techno (and everything in between) party masterclass. But we\u2019re not stopping there! Also on the lineup are local supporting artists Joe Miller, Mount Mike, Moe Aloha as well as White Noise residents Stevie Strafford, Samuel Jay and Luke Lawrence.ROBBIE LOWE (By Your Side)https://soundcloud.com/robbieloweRobbie Lowe is undeniably one of Australia's finest and most influential DJ's for the past two decades. He\u2019s always out to better himself and his art. They say if you love what you do, do what you love. Robbie loves to DJ, openly pledging to play forever. So far been honing his talent for 25 years.Good quality house music is what he loves to play. Always staying to what he loves, Robbie\u2019s consistently a selector of superior, non commercial electronic sounds. Considered world class by fans and peers, Robbie Lowe maintains his presence amongst Australia\u2019s electronic music artists as one of the best. His sets speak for themselves, and as a DJ, Robbie has garnered praise of the highest form from some of the biggest names in the business.Robbie Lowe is a gentleman, a special and incredibly talented DJ with a deep understanding of music. His fans and friends alike love him.HOTEN (43 Degrees Records)https://soundcloud.com/hotenmusicComing from the back of a 10+ year DJ career back in Brazil, Hoten has definitely taken over Sydney by storm over the last few years, as well as headlining events all over Australia, playing main stage at the biggest events and festivals in Sydney and supporting some of the biggest acts in the house and techno industry. His sets are always groovy, energetic and seamless, you\u2019re in for a big treat on each of his performance.He\u2019s recently killing on the production side of things as well, getting support from big acts across the world and bringing his soul in the shape of quality music. Undoubtedly a rising star in Australian\u2019s scene.LILI JOY (By Your Side)https://soundcloud.com/lili-joyOriginally from Bulgaria but growing up in Italy, as a child Lili was surrounded by music and having learnt Violin from a young age 5 and as a teenager she has worked as singer. Around this time she developed a strong passion for collecting and mixing various music.This passion eventually became a career choice within the sunny Sydney club scene.The sun laced water-front bars became a perfect setting for the tropical style which Lili developed. She has since gone on to tour the country performing live sets with a band, performed at festivals across the country, Lili is resident at Burning Seed Festival and after her European and Asian tour in 2017 she performed at Subsonic Festival 2017 and Rabbits Eat Lattice 2018.+ Local legends...JOE MILLER (All Day I Dream)https://soundcloud.com/joe-millerMOUNT MIKE (Suckmusic)https://soundcloud.com/mountmikemusicMOE ALOHAhttps://soundcloud.com/moe-aloha+ White Noise Music residents...STEVIE STRAFFORD (White Noise Music)https://soundcloud.com/steviemfsSAMUEL JAY (White Noise Music)https://soundcloud.com/samueljaymusicLUKE LAWRENCE (White Noise Music)https://soundcloud.com/luke_lawrence",

                "text": "This page is to purchase \"backup tickets\" for a New To Melbourne bus tour. Once a bus tour has sold out, we make this option available for people that really need a tour date.\nHowever, we suggest that, if possible, you purchase \"normal\" tickets for the next tour. You can find all New To Melbourne tour dates on the New To Melbourne facebook page here:\nwww.facebook.com/NewToMelb/events\nBelow is more information about backup tickets for this tour if you would like to join the group.\nHave a great time! :-)New To Melbourne\n===== IMPORTANT\u00a0=====Backup tickets are only available once a tour sells out. They\u2019re designed for people that have friends going on a tour and that missed out on tickets, or those that are leaving Melbourne shortly and can\u2019t make another date or who are otherwise really need to get on a tour but that tried buying too late.\u00a0They're a great option if you really need to get on a tour and are happy to take a chance that there will be room on the day.\nAs the name \"backup\" indicates, the tickets can't guarentee you a seat on the bus (however the refund is 100% guarenteed if there's no room). There's a 50%-90% likelihood that seats will be available on the day and you'll be able to board on the day. The likelihood of being able to board is listed on each ticket type - please see options on the \"buy a ticket\" page.This option was created to help people that really need to get on a tour but missed out on tickets.\n\n===== Why do we have backup tickets? =====\nWe have on average 3-5 people who don\u2019t show up on the day for a tour and they don't message us to let us know that they can\u2019t make it. A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0\nAs mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.\nWe suggest buying these tickets if:- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.\n===== Groups\u00a0=====DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.\n===== Boarding process\u00a0=====Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:\n\nArrive at the meeting point\nLet the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket\nWait until everyone has boarded the bus\nAsk the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.\n\nIf there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)\nNOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.\n\nNew to Melbourne:www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\u00a0\nWe hope that this option is helpful for you :-)\nBest regards,New To Melbourne Team",

You can find all New To Melbourne tour dates on the New To Melbourne facebook page here:</P>\n<P>www.facebook.com/NewToMelb/events</P>\n<P>Below is more information about backup tickets for this tour if you would like to join the group.</P>\n<P>Have a great time! :-)<BR>New To Melbourne</P>\n<P>===== IMPORTANT\u00a0=====<BR>Backup tickets are only available once a tour sells out. They\u2019re designed for people that have friends going on a tour and that missed out on tickets, or those that are leaving Melbourne shortly and can\u2019t make another date or who are otherwise really need to get on a tour but that tried buying too late.\u00a0<SPAN>They're a great option if you really need to get on a tour and are happy to take a chance that there will be room on the day.</SPAN><BR></P>\n<P>As the name \"backup\" indicates, the tickets can't guarentee you a seat on the bus (however the refund is 100% guarenteed if there's no room). There's a 50%-90% likelihood that seats will be available on the day and you'll be able to board on the day. The likelihood of being able to board is listed on each ticket type - please see options on the \"buy a ticket\" page.<BR><BR>This option was created to help people that really need to get on a tour but missed out on tickets.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>===== Why do we have backup tickets? =====</P>\n<P>We have on average 3-5 people who don\u2019t show up on the day for a tour and they don't message us to let us know that they can\u2019t make it. A backup ticket entitles you to one of these spare seats on the bus or a 100% refund if there's isn't space.\u00a0</P>\n<P>As mentioned, there\u2019s a high likelihood (60-90%) chance that there will be room for you if you have a backup ticket - however, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a seat available. You can only accept a refund if there is no empty seats left to board the bus.</P>\n<P>We suggest buying these tickets if:<BR>- you have friends in a group and really want to go with them but the tour sold out before you could get tickets<BR>- if you have a child you need a ticket for and didn't buy a ticket for<BR>- if you\u2019re leaving Melbourne shortly and cannot make the next day.</P>\n<P>===== Groups\u00a0=====<BR>DO NOT buy backup tickets for a group - only use them for individuals or for (maximum) two people. If there's only one seat avilable, we can refund both ticket for you.</P>\n<P>===== Boarding process\u00a0=====<BR>Please note: If you purchase a backup ticket you need to:</P>\n<OL>\n<LI>Arrive at the meeting point</LI>\n<LI>Let the tour guide know you have an unguarenteed ticket</LI>\n<LI>Wait until everyone has boarded the bus</LI>\n<LI>Ask the tour guide if there is spare seats left over that you can take.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>If there is no room available on the day, you will be given a 100% refund (please contact us via our facebook page and we will process the refund)</P>\n<P>NOTE: There are 2 unguaranteed tickets (1st release and 2nd release), please note that the 1st release ticket gets priority over the 2nd release ticket.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>New to Melbourne:<BR><A HREF=\"http://www.facebook.com/NewToMelb\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.facebook.com/NewToMelb</A>\u00a0</P>\n<P>We hope that this option is helpful for you :-)</P>\n<P>Best regards,<BR>New To Melbourne Team</P>"

                "text": "New weekly sessions of Laughter Yoga and Pelvic Floor!\nThe classes starts on 27th April. In this date the class will be FREE!\u00a0\n\nI thought of a session that could combine the two disciplines. In this way it is possible to train the body and the mind to associate the movement of the perineum to the sound of laughter and therefore to the movement that the body makes during laughter. If the exercises make our mind to think about to pay attention to this detail, even in just a few exercises during the session, with time, this movement will come spontaneous even in laughter exercises. For those suffering from losses laughter at this point will really be a feeling of freedom because they will not have to think of anything else other than to laugh!\nBenefits:\n- It changes your mood state instantly by releasing endorphins-the feel good hormones;\u00a0\n- it reduces stress from your life and strengthens the immune system;\n- it increases the net supply of oxygen to the body and brain and improves efficiency while making you feel more energetic,\n- it also is a great social connector and helps develop great caring and sharing network of friendship;\n- lastly it teaches you how to laugh when life gives you challenges. It provides a positive mental attitude and teaches you to smile through difficult times\n- improvement of sports performance\n- increased cell regeneration of the vaginal mucosa\n- increased libido\n- improvement of back muscle problems.\n- decrease in losses\nSessions Structure\n1- Breathing and visualise\nBreathing is the purpose to work on the perineum and on the pelvic floor, so it is essential to deal with it carefully. We\u2019ll visualise the muscular fibres of pelvic floor that slide one against the other, distancing and getting closer together and we\u2019ll try to do the same movement with our hands, by distancing our fingers and then intertwining them. Breathing in and focusing on the pelvic floor muscles and on belly that perform the same movement of the hands is easy to understand the breathing that tells us our body and that we should always perform. Breathing out, the muscles of the belly and pelvic floor contract and the fingers meet again.

In this date the class will be FREE!\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>I thought of a session that could combine the two disciplines. In this way it is possible to train the body and the mind to associate the movement of the perineum to the sound of laughter and therefore to the movement that the body makes during laughter. If the exercises make our mind to think about to pay attention to this detail, even in just a few exercises during the session, with time, this movement will come spontaneous even in laughter exercises. For those suffering from losses laughter at this point will really be a feeling of freedom because they will not have to think of anything else other than to laugh!</P>\n<P>Benefits:</P>\n<P><SPAN>- It changes your mood state instantly by releasing endorphins-the feel good hormones;\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>- i</SPAN>t reduces stress from your life and strengthens the immune system;</P>\n<P>- it increases the net supply of oxygen to the body and brain and improves efficiency while making you feel more energetic,</P>\n<P>- it also is a great social connector and helps develop great caring and sharing network of friendship;</P>\n<P>- lastly it teaches you how to laugh when life gives you challenges. It provides a positive mental attitude and teaches you to smile through difficult times</P>\n<P><SPAN>- improvement of sports performance</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>- increased cell regeneration of the vaginal mucosa</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>- increased libido</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>- improvement of back muscle problems.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>- decrease in losses</SPAN></P>\n<P>Sessions Structure</P>\n<P><SPAN>1- Breathing and visualise</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Breathing is the purpose to work on the perineum and on the pelvic floor, so it is essential to deal with it carefully. We\u2019ll visualise the muscular fibres of pelvic floor that slide one against the other, distancing and getting closer together and we\u2019ll try to do the same movement with our hands, by distancing our fingers and then intertwining them. Breathing in and focusing on the pelvic floor muscles and on belly that perform the same movement of the hands is easy to understand the breathing that tells us our body and that we should always perform. Breathing out, the muscles of the belly and pelvic floor contract and the fingers meet again. During breath out, the energy gets taken upwards and in case of cough, for those suffering from incontinence, not only energy but also small losses!</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>2- Clapping with laughter mantra ho ho ha ha ha (making a small alteration changing ho ho with two inspirations) associated with the control of the perineal movement.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>3- Calcutta laughter (making a small alteration changing ho ho with two inspirations) for energy sharing associated to the control of the perineal movements.\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>4- Exercises and games of laughter</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Always starting from the laugh namaste, laughter of acceptance and laughter of the compliment.
