Join Fudan University's Dr Jiming Zhou as she discusses the concept of \u201cassessment shock\u201d as experienced by Chinese international students in their first year in Australian universities, the cognitive and socio-cultural reasons behind the shock, and the pedagogical implications for assessment design and enactment.\nThis seminar shares findings from a recent project exploring Chinese international students\u2019 perceptions and practices related to assessment tasks in the first year at Deakin University. Ten students were recruited from each of the four broad disciplinary fields most frequently studied by Chinese international students, i.e. management and commerce, engineering and related technologies, information technology, and arts and education. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted to explore students\u2019 understandings and behavior related to various assessment tasks. One unit chair/tutor from each broad discipline was also interviewed to compare and contrast the educators\u2019 perspective. \nFindings suggest prior assessment experience mediates students\u2019 perception of assessment tasks and culture. Students reported difficulties in 1) appreciating the values of some higher-order skills assessed in university contexts; 2) developing sophisticated understandings about \u201cabstract\u201d criteria; and 3) interacting with tutors about the meanings of assessment tasks and the way to move forward. \nThe seminar will conclude with discussions about how understanding \u201cassessment shock\u201d carries the potential to enhance first-year student transition and develop learner assessment literacy.\nAfter Jiming's presentation, join us for afternoon tea to continue the conversation around understanding the experiences of first-year Chinese students in Australian universities.\nThis seminar will be available across all Deakin campuses via Skype for Business (please select your location via the ticketing options for room details), and will also be accessible to all non-Deakin locations online or over the phone (please select this ticketing option for further details).\n\nJiming Zhou is a senior lecturer at Fudan University, China. She holds a PhD in education from the University of Hong Kong. Her current research interests include assessment and learning, educational innovation, and students\u2019 school-university transition.",

                "text": "2019 Miegunyah Public Lecture, presented by Professor John Lygeros, ETH Zurich\r\nWebsite:\u00a0https://events.unimelb.edu.au/events/12336-feedback-everywhere\r\nSpeaker: Professor John Lygeros, Professor of Computation and Control and Head, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich\r\n\r\nTitle: Feedback everywhere\r\n\r\nDate/Time: Tuesday 21 May, 6.30-7.30pm, Refreshments from 6pm\r\n\r\nLocation: Woodward Conference Centre, 10th floor, Melbourne Law (Building 106), 185 Pelham St, Carlton VIC 3053\r\n\r\nAbstract: What do self driving cars, power grids and homeostasis in biology have in common? Seemingly not much. If one looks \u201cunder the hood\u201d, however, one discovers that they all rely on a common principle that renders their operation robust and reliable. This principle, known as feedback, is intuitive: see where you are, compare to where you want to be, and move in the direction that reduces the difference between the two. Though the feedback principle itself is simple to explain, understanding its implications, uses and limitations is far from it and forms the topic of a branch of engineering known as automatic control.\r\nThe talk will outline the main ideas of feedback, automation and control motivated by examples of their use in biology, transportation, energy systems and beyond.\r\n\r\nBio: John Lygeros grew up in Athens, Greece where he graduated from Athens College in 1987. He completed a B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering in 1990 and an M.Sc. degree in Systems Control in 1991, both at the Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, London, U.K.. In 1996 he obtained a Ph.D. degree from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of California, Berkeley. In the period 1996-1999 he held a series of research appointments at the National Automated Highway Systems Consortium, M.I.T., and U.C. Berkeley. In parallel, he also worked as a part-time research engineer at SRI International, Menlo Park, California, and as a Visiting Professor at the Department of Mathematics of the Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France. Between 2000 and 2003 he was a University Lecturer at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, U.K., and a Fellow of Churchill College. Between 2003 and 2006 he was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Greece. In July 2006 he joined the Automatic Control Laboratory of ETH Zurich where he is currently serving as the Professor for Computation and Control and the Head of the laboratory.\r\nHis research interests include modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems, with applications to biochemical networks and large-scale systems such as power networks, surveillance systems and air traffic management. He has received several awards both for his research and for his teaching, including the George S. Axelby Outstanding Paper Award of the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control and the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching of ETH Zurich.\r\nJohn Lygeros is a Fellow of the IEEE, a member of the IET and the Technical Chamber of Greece, and serves as the Treasurer of the International Federation of Automatic Control.\r\n\r\nEnquiries: lynb@unimelb.edu.au\r\n\u00a0",
