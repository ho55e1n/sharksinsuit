                "text": "Do you find health and fitness hard? Or even just harder than you think it \u2018should\u2019 be?\nThese views could be preventing you from achieving something that deep down you know you really want. Let me explain\u2026\nMost people who think fitness is hard, or unenjoyable, or painful, or just too much effort, will be very good at avoiding the very things that give them results.\u00a0\nAnd what happens when we avoid the things that give us what we want the most?\u00a0\nWe either lose faith in ourselves, or resort to negative self-talk and distract ourselves from the pain by eating, drinking, watching TV or becoming overly focussed on work/family/friends or anything else that stops us from facing the fact that we\u2019re not following through for ourselves.\nNo wonder why so many people have an emotional connection to their health and fitness results!\nThe great news is that changing the way you \u2018think\u2019 about your goals will instantly make everything easier.\u00a0 Let\u2019s break it down a little more\u2026\nLike all things in life, our ability to achieve the levels of health and fitness we desire is dictated by our mindset i.e. the way we think and behave.\nHave you ever set your alarm with the full intention to go for a morning workout before work, only to ignore it in the morning?\nMindset.\nHave you ever said that you were going to have 2 weeks of no chocolate/coffee/alcohol/cake (my personal weakness!) and then broken your promise to yourself in the first week\u2026again, and again?\nMindset.\nWhat about this\u2026have you ever not signed up for something because you\u2019re already telling yourself that you\u2019ll probably fail?\nMindset. Mindset. Mindset.\nMost people already know what they NEED to do to get the results they want. So why aren\u2019t we all ticking off our check lists and realising our dreams? MINDSET!\nSo if you want to look and feel phenomenal not just next month, but for the rest of your life, then it\u2019s important to understand how to change\u2026yep, you guessed it\u2026your mindset.\nAnd it is possible. We see it all the time. Which is why we want to share our methods with you.
