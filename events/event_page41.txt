                "text": "There are renewed calls to regulate social media companies in an efforts to tackle online hate and extremism following the terrorist attack by an Australian white supremacist in New Zealand on March 15th 2019. The New Zealand Prime Minister has said platforms are \"publishers not postmen\" and therefore culpable, while the Australian Prime Minister has called for greater artificial intelligence solutions to address the threat.\n\u00a0\nThis talk will look at the online element of the Christchurch attack and the response on Facebook by the far right and their followers. The online hate spread during four other incidents will also be examined: the 2014 Martin Place siege, 2017 Bourke street attack, the 2018 Flinders Street attack, the 2018 Bourke Street attack. The wider problem of online hate will be introduced with an overview of developments that have changed or tried to change the way major social media platforms address the problem. The issues of reporting and monitoring by experts, platform staff and artificial intelligence, and the limits of these approaches will be considered. The cultural, ethical and legal challenges in responding will be discussed.\n",

The New Zealand Prime Minister has said platforms are \"publishers not postmen\" and therefore culpable, while the Australian Prime Minister has called for greater artificial intelligence solutions to address the threat.</P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P>This talk will look at the online element of the Christchurch attack and the response on Facebook by the far right and their followers. The online hate spread during four other incidents will also be examined: the 2014 Martin Place siege, 2017 Bourke street attack, the 2018 Flinders Street attack, the 2018 Bourke Street attack. The wider problem of online hate will be introduced with an overview of developments that have changed or tried to change the way major social media platforms address the problem. The issues of reporting and monitoring by experts, platform staff and artificial intelligence, and the limits of these approaches will be considered.

This tourism attraction represents the beginnings of an early conservation movement at Maldon, long before the National Trust classified the town in1966.

Claudia suffered massive bleeding, and her heart started to fail which lead to the transplant team having to crack her chest open, put her heart on bypass and try and stem the bleeding.\u00a0\nThey had to leave her chest open overnight but they were successful the next day to stop the bleeding and close her chest.\u00a0\nNow she is in the fight of her life and her family need our help to survive along right next to her. We are funding to allow them to stay away from their work so they can be by her side as well as look after their 3 other children - another one of which also suffers from cystic fibrosis.\nThat is why\u00a0we are putting on a screening of \u2018Five Feet Apart\u2019. It\u2019s a romantic film, but also a film about living with cystic fibrosis and how you can sometimes be separated by the people you love most. Very fitting for what Claudia is going through.\u00a0\nFilm synopsis:\u00a0Seventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, an impossibly charming teen who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction.\nCLICK HERE FOR TRAILER\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\n***If you are planning to come and you or your children have cystic fibrosis, please be aware that there may be other people attending with CF. Please take appropriate actions like wearing your mask to avoid cross-contamination\n\u00a0",
