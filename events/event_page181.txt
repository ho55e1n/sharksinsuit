Then this two day skill development workshop may be for you.\r\nThis workshop is incorporates and extends the one day MI Developing Skills, offering more in depth learning and time for practice.\u00a0While MI offers practical and accessible skills to try from the outset, the approach takes time and practice to make the most of its potential to help us have more meaningful and productive conversations about change.With minimal lecture-based learning, this workshop provides participants to practice core skills in a positive learning environment with coached feedback.\u00a0 The aim is to have fun revisiting the skills, and gain more focus in their ongoing practice.\u00a0The workshop extends the foundation skills training, including deepening reflections, working with difficulty, exploring the role of values and working with change talk.\u00a0The learning objectives include:\r\n\r\nRefresh and deepen understanding of the MI framework\r\nLearn from observation and small group practice\r\nDeepen understanding of guiding within a client-centred approach\r\nPractice core component skills, such as developing useful complex reflections within change conversations\r\nPractice working with the four processes of change conversations: Engage, focus, evoke and plan.\r\nApply MI principles to working with challenging presentations\r\nPractice identifying core personal values and their relevance to the change process\r\nPractice identifying and working with different types of change talk\r\nPractice basic coding of both clinician and client talk\r\nDevelop strategies to monitor our use of the skills and continue to develop after the workshop is over.\r\n\r\nRequired prior training\r\nAs this workshop has been developed to deepen existing understanding of MI, it is important that all participants have prior training in MI, preferably the equivalent of at least a 2 day foundation skills course. As MI has also been evolving, it is recommended that participants also are familiar with the changes to MI that were presented in the 3rd edition version of Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change (2013) by William Miller and Steve Rollnick. If you have any questions about whether your prior exposure to MI is sufficient, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\nWorkshop details\r\nThe workshop will be held on the lower level of the Van Raay Centre at Ceres Environment Park in Room 1 (Rooms 2-4 combined).
