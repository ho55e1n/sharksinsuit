                "text": "\nDidirri\u2019s\u00a0challenging and thoughtful writing, combined with on-stage charisma and relatable depth, has continually won over listeners around the world. Simultaneously heartbreaking and healing, approaching real issues with smile and charm,\u00a0Didirri\u00a0is an artist with something to say. His uninhibited lyrics tug at raw nerves, while his charming melodies soothe your heart - provoking a wild thought and calming your heady mind all at once.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGrowing up in the regional\u00a0Australian\u00a0town of Warrnambool,\u00a0Didirri\u00a0liked to push the boundaries of what was and wasn\u2019t acceptable at school. Sort of.\u00a0\u201cI was a bit of a\u00a0cheeky\u00a0nerd\u201d\u00a0chuckles the now 23-year-old, recalling how he\u2019d routinely cut French class to practice piano in the music room.\u00a0\u201cThe teachers didn\u2019t\u00a0always\u00a0like me but\u00a0neither did\u00a0the cool kids.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a teenager\u00a0Didirri\u00a0earned pocket money by performing in the town\u2019s cafes, vying for the attention of patrons more concerned with their\u00a0wine\u00a0or\u00a0breakfast. Struggling to be heard over the din of conversation and coffee machines, his father offered some guidance. He said, \u2018You need to tell people what your songs are about otherwise they\u2019re not going to listen in the same way.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe singer-songwriter \u2013 whose name is an homage to the Indigenous meditative word for \u201cdeep, quiet listening\u201d \u2013 was raised by a painting mother and children\u2019s\u00a0entertainer\u00a0father. He first got a taste for the road when he went on tour with his dad in fourth grade, helping as a roadie every now and then, and singing back-up. After spending his teens in bands and partaking in theatre performances at school,\u00a0Didirri\u00a0undertook a degree in jazz at Victoria University.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFast forward to 2014 when\u00a0Didirri\u00a0had moved to Melbourne, where he played his first solo show under his own name at Melbourne\u2019s Evelyn Hotel. With his father\u2019s advice still ringing in his ears, soon his gigs became renowned not only for his songs, but for the hush that settled over the room as he talked about their meaning. (Just one of the reasons Triple J included him in their 10 Best Live Shows Of 2017.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to get people\u2019s attention in any other way, and I cared enough about my music to know that I wanted people to listen,\u201d\u00a0he reasons.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the time he was living in a shed out the back of a friend\u2019s house, which he\u2019d converted into a bedroom. It was there he recorded his first demos on an old four-track machine, writing \u201cMeasurements\u201d on a cassette because\u00a0\u201call of my songs\u00a0seem to be\u00a0me holding up a measuring tape to the world, a measuring tape against the things that I\u2019ve done\u00a0assessing\u00a0whether I shape up\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMeasurements\u00a0became the title of his debut six-track EP, which he recorded periodically over the space of a few months in 2017 at Collingwood\u2019s Rolling Stock Studio with producer (and artist in his own right) Hayden\u00a0Calnin. Determined to handle all the instrumentation himself,\u00a0Didirri\u00a0called upon others only when his vision outstripped his expertise, such as on the howling horn parts in \u201cFormaldehyde\u201d. Part folk, part alternative, part pop and part aching alt-country,\u00a0Measurements\u00a0combines\u00a0Didirri\u2019s\u00a0honeyed\u00a0vocals with dynamic, organic and at-times soaring acoustic accompaniment, topped off by deeply personal lyrics that often find him trying to learn from past mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy aim with these songs was to go as far down the rabbit hole as\u00a0you\u00a0could emotionally so that you\u00a0emerge\u00a0stronger,\u201d\u00a0he explains.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOpening track \u201cBlind You\u201d is\u00a0\u201ca letter to an ex\u201d\u00a0that explores the idea that\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s okay to say you fell in love with someone and that person is still there and they\u2019re still good, you just don\u2019t work together from a life perspective.\u201d\u00a0\u201cFormaldehyde\u201d, meanwhile, is inspired by the art and struggles of Frida Kahlo, and is\u00a0\u201cdedicated to all the inspiring, strong women in life\u201d. \u201cJude\u201d, with its anthemic cry of \u201cI\u2019m a fool for pain\u201d, tackles the\u00a0black dog\u00a0of depression\u00a0so\u00a0powerfully\u00a0that a fan in Adelaide approached\u00a0Didirri\u00a0after a show to thank him as it\u00a0\u201cpulled them back from the edge\u201d. \u201cBird Sounds\u201d reflects on\u00a0Didirri\u2019s\u00a0search for simplicity; \u201cWorth The Wait\u201d the loss and confusion of heartbreak. And then there\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Last Night Out Of My Head\u201d, a song of romantic redemption written the night after\u00a0Didirri\u00a0reunited with a love.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven though (Although???) these songs are only now appearing packaged together as an EP, the three most recent singles \u201cBlind You\u201d, \u201cFormaldehyde\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Last Night Out Of My Head\u201d have each enjoyed high rotation on Triple J and have collectively been streamed more than six million times globally.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWord has spread overseas, with\u00a0Didirri\u00a0recently returning from a run of international festivals including SXSW, The Great Escape and Primavera Sound, a tour on which he sold out his first ever London show at The\u00a0Shacklewell\u00a0Arms. All of these on the back of recent Australian festivals such as Fairgrounds, Boogie Fest, NYE On The Hill and\u00a0Splendour\u00a0In The Grass, not to mention a sold-out headlining tour of the country.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNot bad for an artist only just releasing his first official EP.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty pragmatic, I don\u2019t set my sights very high,\u201d\u00a0he offers.\u00a0\u201cI really just try to focus on being better every day. I remember I woke up one morning and I thought, don\u2019t try and impress people, just try and improve and you\u2019ll impress them by accident. And that has been driving me ever since.\u201d\u00a0He laughs.\u00a0\u201cBut it definitely shocked me that I announced a world tour before my EP\u2019s out.\u201d\u00a0\n",

Being able to identify risk, assess the situation and respond appropriately is important, and requires not only training, but practice. With our Crisis Management workshop your participants will understand that a crisis can occur any time. They will develop skills needed for certain negative events.
