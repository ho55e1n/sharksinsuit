Although Australia has had uninterrupted economic growth over the last 25\u00a0years, there are\u00a0rising levels of housing stress and homelessness, and record levels of household debt. Appropriate housing is a vital foundation that supports education and employment pathways, yet many Australians with disabilities face overwhelming housing challenges. Recent research confirms that unsafe and poor-quality housing can have a detrimental impact on people\u2019s health, and that people with disabilities are especially disadvantaged when it comes to housing options. \r\nOur panel will discuss what's driving this housing inequality, explore the relationship between housing, disability and health, the broader policy context and the priorities ahead to work towards a system that\u2019s fair, equitable and safe for the growing number of Australians with disabilities.\r\nSpeakers\r\nPeter Mares\u00a0(Moderator), Author of\u00a0No Place Like Home: Repairing Australia's Housing Crisis\u00a0and lead moderator with The Cranlana Centre for Ethical Leadership.

He currently leads the NDIS Housing Pathways Program\u00a0for the Melbourne Disability Institute.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWho should attend?\u00a0\r\nPeople with disability and families seeking housing options, researchers, housing providers, investors, support workers, policy makers, and anyone who is interested in how safe, affordable and quality housing could improve the lives of people with disabilities in Australia.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo you have a question you would like answered at the event?\r\nIf you have specific questions you would like to ask our speakers, please email your question to:\u00a0md-i@unimelb.edu.au\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nAccessibility\r\nThe venue is wheelchair accessible and there is a quiet room in the auditorium.
