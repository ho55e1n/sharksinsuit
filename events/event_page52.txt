This event teaches the critical foundations and experiences. Shadows Of Tantra have been running coaching and events in Melbourne since 2009.  'Shadow Tantra' is an approach to engaging in darker erotic interactions where the focus is on heart and connection. From which the archetypal polarity play can be as wicked, kinky or as tender (or whatever blend suits you) as you want.  Contrary to uninformed opinions, such perspectives for many people are exactly what they require in order to let go into very dark and incredibly satisfying parts of themselves. Shadow Tantra is it's own alchemical entity and is NOT 'lite-on' BDSM!!  Shadow Tantra places 'connection/authenticity/intimacy' first and 'thrills/activities' next. (The opposite approach to other well-known forms of erotic shadow play.) NOT at the expense of pleasure and excitement, but bringing even more depth and satisfaction. (And greatly reducing opportunities for disconnected insensitive experiences.)  Yes, play can be soft and flowing and incredibly satisfying. Yet can also be intensely dark if that's what is the authentic potential between you. Depending on the truth of the moment, what participants want, and the unique connection.\nThis is not a play-party of a kink event, but a genuine educational environment. Yes there will be practical exercises, but there will all be fully-clothed. NO direct sexual contact takes place at this event.\nNO Refunds are available once you have bought your ticket. In exceptional circumstances of hardship you may be able to transfer your ticket to a future event. You may possibly transfer your ticket to someone else. In either circumstance contact ShadowsOfTantra@gmail.com\nFor full details on this and related events please visit: www.facebook.com/ShadowsOfTantra/events",
