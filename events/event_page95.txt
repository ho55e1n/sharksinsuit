Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep.

He sees it as a means towards living a calmer, happier and more interesting life, and he is keen to share this with others.\nNeil started his practice over 17 years ago, mostly seeking strategies to better manage the life challenges he was experiencing at the time.

After an experience with mindfulness and meditation, he developed a fascination for it and has since participated in a significant number of meditation retreats, practices and workshops. Some interesting examples are several years of mindfulness meditation practice with a Buddhist lama, the challenging \u201cVipassana\u201d 10-day silent retreat, and an Eckhart Tolle retreat in Costa Rica.

Through discussions, musical performance, and art installation we invite you to consider the inner lives of trees, and re-examine your relationship with them.\n\nScience Gossip: Woodland Rumours and Thinking Trees\u00a0is part of ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019 presented by CLIMARTE.\n\nSPEAKERS and PRESENTERS:\nShort presentations and interactive activities will be presented by a selection of scientists, artists, and philosophers.\nKeynote introduction by Dr Monica Gagliano\nMonica Gagliano is Research Associate Professor of Evolutionary Ecology.\u00a0She is currently based at the University of Sydney as a Research Affiliate at the Sydney Environment Institute and a Senior Research Fellow at the School of Life and Environmental Sciences, opening the doors of the brand-new BI Lab \u2013 Biological Intelligence Lab.\u00a0She is the author of the new book\u00a0Thus Spoke the Plant, numerous scientific articles in the fields of animal and plant behavioural and evolutionary ecology, and is the co-editor of\u00a0The Green Thread: Dialogues with the Vegetal World\u00a0(Lexington Books, 2015) and\u00a0The Language of Plants: Science, Philosophy and Literature\u00a0(Minnesota University Press, 2017). Her work has extended the concept of cognition (including perception, learning processes, memory and consciousness) in plants. Gagliano has pioneered the brand-new research field of plant bioacoustics, for the first time experimentally demonstrating that plants emit their own 'voices' and, moreover, detect and respond to the sounds of their environments. We are offering discounted presale copies of Monica's book, to be signed by the author on the night. For more information about her work, visit:\u00a0www.monicagagliano.com.\nAnna Madeleine\nAnna Madeleine is an artist working with AR, VR, drawing, animation and installation, to explore intersections between art and science. She has a PhD in Media Arts from UNSW Art & Design (2014) and is a Lecturer in Printmedia & Drawing at ANU School of Art & Design. She has had solo exhibitions in New York, Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Montreal and Bandung, and participated in residencies with Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts, Paris, Bundanon Trust, Asialink Arts, and the School of Cinematic Arts, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.\nVicki Hallett\nVicki Hallett is a clarinetist, composer and sound artist who graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts and the University of Melbourne. She has composed, produced and performed in live concerts, solo recordings ranging from chamber music to sound art and acoustic ecology. Through a unique approach, combining acoustic ecology, scientific analysis and innovative performance practices, Vicki reshapes the role of interdisciplinary research. This exploration has led her to develop a collaborative concept with Cornell University's Elephant Listening Project. In 2017, Vicki attended the international residency, Sonic Mmabolela, where she performed on Mabolel Rock with a pod of Hippopotami.\nDr Sapphire McMullan-Fisher\nSapphire is an ecologist who has special interest in the conservation of biodiversity, particularly the macrofungi and mosses. She did her doctorate at the University of Tasmania and has been actively involved with Fungimap* since 1999.\u00a0She is the regional representative for Australasia for the International Society for Fungal Conservation, and is active with community groups including field naturalist clubs and Landcare groups. Having lived in four states and travelled across Australia\u2019s landscapes she has worked with many fungal community groups to raise the profile of local fungi and the important roles fungi play in our environment.\nAdjunct Professor Freya Mathews \nFreya Mathews is Adjunct Professor of Environmental Philosophy at Latrobe University and a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Her books include The Ecological Self (1991), Ecology and Democracy (editor) (1996), For Love of Matter: a Contemporary Panpsychism (2003), Journey to the Source of the Merri (2003), Reinhabiting Reality: towards a Recovery of Culture (2005), Ardea: a philosophical novella (2015) and Without Animals Life is not Worth Living (2015). She is the author of over eighty articles in the area of ecological philosophy and panpsychism.

Her work has extended the concept of cognition (including perception, learning processes, memory and consciousness) in plants. Gagliano has pioneered the brand-new research field of plant bioacoustics, for the first time experimentally demonstrating that plants emit their own 'voices' and, moreover, detect and respond to the sounds of their environments. We are offering discounted presale copies of Monica's book, to be signed by the author on the night.
