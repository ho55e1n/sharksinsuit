What does it look like for His Voice to become activated in every sphere of our lives? What does it look like when His Voice activates those areas of our lives that are dormant with potential? \u00a0Our aim is that we go beyond using spiritual gifts just as a blessing to the church and see them being activated in every believer to build the kingdom and shape culture. Over three incredible days, we will encounter the Father through worship with Stairway Music, and the School of Prophets Worship Team. You will learn from a variety of Prophets who are working to shape culture, and church leaders who are thinking Apostolically of how the Prophetic can partner with, branch out, and support church communities, cities, and nations. School of Prophets is known for valuing the Father's voice and equipping people to impact the culture they find themselves in through the prophetic and tangible overflow of His heart. It is our heart at SOP is to embrace a lifestyle of encountering His heart for ourselves, and then to pour out his love on others. \n\n\n\u201cGOD\u2019S VOICE, ACTIVATED CREATION\u201d - Gen 1\n\n\n\n\nThis year Matt & Deseree Gonzales from The Mission, Vacaville CA, join us for the first time in bringing their unique gift set in seeing the Prophetic go beyond the 4 walls of the church and see culture shaped and cities transformed. They both carry dynamic giftings to both equip and bless. \nWe\u2019ve also invited Craig Petty, Lead Pastor, Stairway Church, and David McHugh Community Pastor, Stairway Church, to join us to share their insight, giftings, experience at a special Leaders Advance on Thursday 13th June.\nAs well as our guests, we also have our very own SOP Founders/Directors, Gary & Sarah Morgan.\n\nOver 3 incredible days, filled with Worship, Word, Activation and Prophetic Ministry, we welcome you to join us as we see God\u2019s Voice, Activated in your life and your destiny Activated by God\u2019s Voice!\n\nTo learn more details about Speak, please visit our website HERE.\n\n",
