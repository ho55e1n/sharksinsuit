Prof. Gabrielle Brand, Monash University\nSeminar:\u00a0Depth Of Field: A reflective learning resource for health professions educators \nThe learning landscape of higher education environment is changing, with an increased focus over the past decade on how educators might begin to cultivate reflective skills in health professions students. Reflective practice can promote self-awareness, allow for ongoing self-monitoring of professional practice and better prepare students for an increasingly challenging health environment.\nThe interactive seminar will commence with outlining the background and research conducted in developing the reflective learning techniques. It will then lead participants through an innovative, consumer and research driven, reflective learning resource titled Depth of Field that uses MRI art, documentary style photographs and audio-narrated film of patients. The session will encourage participants to engage with the resource, to pause, explore, reflect and share their own educator and learning experiences in small groups. Participants will also have the opportunity to explore and consider ways in which they can embed/integrate visual methodologies as a catalyst to encourage individual and/or collective reflection in health professions students.\nVenue:\nNew Horizons Building\n20 Research Way, Monash University, Clayton Campus\u00a0\nRoom G29\nMap of campus\n\u00a0\nPresenter Biography\nGabrielle Brand is an Associate Professor (Education Focused) at Monash Nursing & Midwifery.
