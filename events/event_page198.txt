Melbourne bred progressive alternative rock juggernaut Circles are today announcing their \u2018Winter\u2019 Tour across Australian landscapes, and to the shores of New Zealand throughout July & August 2019, with a new music video for their single \u2018Winter\u2019 (off latest album The Last One) forthcoming as well. In addition, they are taking fellow Wild Thing Ballarat prog-punk sensation Ebonivory along for the ride. With each band\u2019s recent performances at PROGFEST 2019 completely breathtaking, and with Circles' live show one of the most powerful and mind blowing going around, this is a tour you definitely do not want to miss! \nThe tour lands in New Zealand first, where Auckland\u2019s post-alternative rock kings\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0will headline shows in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, then returns to Australia for\u00a0Circles\u2019 headline shows in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Belgrave, and Ballarat.\n2018 was a watershed year for\u00a0Circles, releasing their masterpiece album\u00a0The Last One\u00a0through\u00a0Wild Thing Records\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand and\u00a0Season Of Mist\u00a0internationally.\u00a0Louder\u00a0said that The Last One was \"...very much in a similar fashion to countrymen Karnivool, Circles have crafted a modern progressive tapestry with plenty of wider appeal thanks to songwriting nous coupled with their apparent technicality.\" They then joined\u00a0TesseracT\u00a0on their\u00a0Australian Tour in September\u00a0as special guests. Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast. Upon their return to Australia, they dazzled audiences on tour with\u00a0Dead Letter Circus\u00a0in December, before mesmerising\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0in January 2019, with memorable performances as the festival\u2019s Australian headliner playing to full houses every night.\u00a0\nHailing from Ballarat in rural Victoria, Australia,\u00a0Ebonivory\u00a0creates an engaging mosaic of raw emotion, complex rhythmic devices, and prismatic melody. The world-class 5-piece ensemble employs a unique distillation of alternative rock, progressive metal, post-hardcore and modern punk, delivering a breathtaking performance that unifies musicians, melomaniacs, and casual listeners alike. Recently, they announced singing to\u00a0Wild Things Presents\u00a0for Management.\nABOUT CIRCLES\nThe Last One,\u00a0an album of tremendous power and lyrical inventiveness, delivers on the promise made on their\u00a0Basick Records\u00a0debut album\u00a0Infinitas\u00a0(2013). With guitarist Ben Rechter assuming the role of lead vocalist and fellow band members Ted Furuhashi (guitar/backing vocals), David Hunter (drums), and Drew Patton (bass guitar/screamed vocals) providing a maelstrom of musical brutality, Circles have written and recorded a simply phenomenal album. The band\u2019s uniquely designed off-kilter stadium-like riffs and dynamic grooves, exemplified in the track\u00a0Dream Sequence, beautifully contrast with breathtaking soaring vocals and catchy hooks apparent in highlight song\u00a0Tether,\u00a0with new front-man Ben Rechter\u2019s lush melodic singing styling instantly becoming a signature of Circles\u2019 ever expanding sound.\u00a0\nFormed in 2010 by Ted Furuhashi, David Hunter and Drew Patton, Circles have constantly been at the forefront of progressive heavy music, with their musical foundations becoming a strong component of the worldwide djent movement. Their previous releases, 2011\u2019s EP\u00a0The Compass\u00a0(Basick Records) and 2013\u2019s\u00a0Infinitas,\u00a0garnered unanimously positive reaction from fans and critics across the globe. Circles' past European jaunts have included supporting heavy music luminaries such as\u00a0The Dillinger Escape Plan,\u00a0Monuments, and\u00a0After The Burial. In Australia, they\u2019ve toured nationally as direct support to eminent rock and metal acts such as\u00a0Periphery,\u00a0Fear Factory,\u00a0Twelve Foot Ninja, and\u00a0Ne Obliviscaris, while also performing at the nation\u2019s premier progressive music festival\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0on three occasions.\n\n\n",

With each band\u2019s recent performances at PROGFEST 2019 completely breathtaking, and with Circles' live show one of the most powerful and mind blowing going around, this is a tour you definitely do not want to miss! </SPAN></P>\n<P>The tour lands in New Zealand first, where Auckland\u2019s post-alternative rock kings\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0will headline shows in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, then returns to Australia for\u00a0Circles\u2019 headline shows in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Belgrave, and Ballarat.</P>\n<P>2018 was a watershed year for\u00a0Circles, releasing their masterpiece album\u00a0<I>The Last One</I>\u00a0through\u00a0Wild Thing Records\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand and\u00a0Season Of Mist\u00a0internationally.\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://sgcmedia.acemlna.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=892A4126A3A12988\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Louder</A>\u00a0said that The Last One was \"<I>...very much in a similar fashion to countrymen Karnivool, Circles have crafted a modern progressive tapestry with plenty of wider appeal thanks to songwriting nous coupled with their apparent technicality.</I>\" They then joined\u00a0TesseracT\u00a0on their\u00a0Australian Tour in September\u00a0as special guests. Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast. Upon their return to Australia, they dazzled audiences on tour with\u00a0Dead Letter Circus\u00a0in December, before mesmerising\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0in January 2019, with memorable performances as the festival\u2019s Australian headliner playing to full houses every night.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Hailing from Ballarat in rural Victoria, Australia,\u00a0<STRONG>Ebonivory</STRONG>\u00a0creates an engaging mosaic of raw emotion, complex rhythmic devices, and prismatic melody. The world-class 5-piece ensemble employs a unique distillation of alternative rock, progressive metal, post-hardcore and modern punk, delivering a breathtaking performance that unifies musicians, melomaniacs, and casual listeners alike. Recently, they announced singing to\u00a0Wild Things Presents\u00a0for Management.</P>\n<P><STRONG>ABOUT CIRCLES</STRONG></P>\n<P><I>The Last One,\u00a0</I>an album of tremendous power and lyrical inventiveness, delivers on the promise made on their\u00a0Basick Records\u00a0debut album\u00a0<I>Infinitas\u00a0</I>(2013). With guitarist Ben Rechter assuming the role of lead vocalist and fellow band members Ted Furuhashi (guitar/backing vocals), David Hunter (drums), and Drew Patton (bass guitar/screamed vocals) providing a maelstrom of musical brutality, Circles have written and recorded a simply phenomenal album. The band\u2019s uniquely designed off-kilter stadium-like riffs and dynamic grooves, exemplified in the track\u00a0<I>Dream Sequence</I>, beautifully contrast with breathtaking soaring vocals and catchy hooks apparent in highlight song\u00a0<I>Tether,\u00a0</I>with new front-man Ben Rechter\u2019s lush melodic singing styling instantly becoming a signature of Circles\u2019 ever expanding sound.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Formed in 2010 by Ted Furuhashi, David Hunter and Drew Patton, Circles have constantly been at the forefront of progressive heavy music, with their musical foundations becoming a strong component of the worldwide djent movement. Their previous releases, 2011\u2019s EP\u00a0<I>The Compass\u00a0</I>(Basick Records) and 2013\u2019s\u00a0<I>Infinitas,\u00a0</I>garnered unanimously positive reaction from fans and critics across the globe. Circles' past European jaunts have included supporting heavy music luminaries such as\u00a0The Dillinger Escape Plan,\u00a0Monuments, and\u00a0After The Burial. In Australia, they\u2019ve toured nationally as direct support to eminent rock and metal acts such as\u00a0Periphery,\u00a0Fear Factory,\u00a0Twelve Foot Ninja, and\u00a0Ne Obliviscaris, while also performing at the nation\u2019s premier progressive music festival\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0on three occasions.</P>\n<H6><BR></H6>\n<HR>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/76013763/circlestour2019webportrait.jpg\"></P>"

I am dedicated to helping people improve their lives and shape their future. Since discovering the Wim Hof Method in 2010, I\u2019ve come to understand that I have found a method that will not only help me improve the lives of my patients and those around me, but also my own life. Everything that I learned about the Wim Hof Method is from the master himself, my track record includes attending the week-long retreat in Poland in 2014, Spain 2015, Poland 2016, And in 2016 I managed to bring Wim to Australia for the week-long retreat and worked as his assistant. I have also helped organize and manage all Wim Hof Method events all over Australia and work very closely with his team. Since my introduction to the Method, it has become an integral part of my life. Practicing the method every day is now an\u00a0essential part of my daily routine and a crucial aspect of my therapeutic practice.

I am dedicated to helping people improve their lives and shape their future. Since discovering the Wim Hof Method in 2010, I\u2019ve come to understand that I have found a method that will not only help me improve the lives of my patients and those around me, but also my own life. Everything that I learned about the Wim Hof Method is from the master himself, my track record includes attending the week-long retreat in Poland in 2014, Spain 2015, Poland 2016, And in 2016 I managed to bring Wim to Australia for the week-long retreat and worked as his assistant. I have also helped organize and manage all Wim Hof Method events all over Australia and work very closely with his team. Since my introduction to the Method, it has become an integral part of my life. Practicing the method every day is now an\u00a0essential part of my daily routine and a crucial aspect of my therapeutic practice. Enough about me I want to meet you and share with you what I have learned over the decade from the Man him self.\u00a0</P>\r\n<H3 CLASS=\"text-justify tickbox text-georgia\">What Can You Expect From The Weekend\u00a0retreat?</H3>\r\n<P CLASS=\"text-justify tickbox text-georgia\">You\u2019ll unlock the potential of your body and mind by mastering the techniques of the Wim Hof Method.

In real life, Lee explains, all of us are embodied and everything we do, even our thinking, comes from, through and/or despite our bodies. In Writing the Body participants will learn to write in a way that not only pays attention to this central fact of human existence, but also uses the body as a source of inspiration. This workshop will look at the body as a multidimensional entity \u2013 physical, cultural, and a singular marker of an individual; the source of our pleasures and difficulties. Lee will discuss what importance body may assume in the participants\u2019 projects. Writers will learn how to describe appearance, body language and other bodily gestures vividly and also in a way that deepens characterisation. Participants will learn how to describe sensory experiences, including writing erotic scenes. They will also learn how to describe pain in ways particular to the characters they\u2019re writing about. Explore the common pitfalls in writing about the body and how to avoid them. The workshop incorporates theory, discussion, examples from fiction and non-creative fiction and writing exercises.\nAbout the presenter:\nLee Kofman is the author of five books, including memoirs Imperfect: How bodies shape the people we become (2019, Affirm Press) and The Dangerous Bride (2014, Melbourne University Press), co-editor of Rebellious Daughters (2016, Ventura Press) and editor of Split (2019, Ventura Press), an anthology of personal essays by prominent Australian authors.

                "text": "The only course of its kind in Australia to integrate the craftsmanship of the nation's first and finest art foundry with a curriculum designed by an artist with more than 25 years professional art teaching experience and\r\nbest of all,\u00a0your unique hand modelled piece will be cast in bronze, finished and patinated by Meridian; Australia's premiere lost wax art foundry. This object will last for all time, be finished to world class standards and represents great value being included in the enrollment fee.\r\n\r\nCan anyone enrol?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nYes, classes are informal in nature and flexible according to each individual's ability and working method but also small enough to afford significant one on one tutoring by our highly experienced course leaders. We welcome creatives wanting to refine or learn new skills as well as complete beginners, no experience is necessary, everyone is welcome.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat can I make? \u00a0\r\nWhatever your creative mind chooses to. There are no \"rules\" as to the subject or style of your composition, only a size limitation - it cannot exceed 250mm in any direction.\u00a0Included with your enrollment are a set of hand modeling tools allowing you to work on your pieces outside of class should you wish. You need only bring an open\u00a0mind and an enthusiasm for creative exploration!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhere are you located? \u00a0\r\nYou'll find us at 8 Spring St, Fitzroy, just off Johnston Street and behind the Goodlife Gym. Both the 96 and 112 trams are only a couple of minutes walk away. If coming by train the 96 tram will connect you from Parliament Station. Some free street parking is available but time limits may apply. Paid off street parking is available a short walk away.\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to bring? \u00a0\r\nAll materials and modelling tools are supplied but you are most welcome to bring your own tools or other aids should you wish. Have photos, items, drawings or other inspirational tools? Bring them along! If not don't worry, we have everything you need. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to wear?\r\nAprons are available for student use but it's best to assume you will get a little dirty in what is a functioning art foundry environment. Comfy closed toe shoes are a good idea for the same reason!\u00a0The classroom is climate controlled.\r\nAccessibility? \u00a0\r\nOur classroom is on the first floor via a set of stairs. We regret that wheelchair access is not available at this time. For safety reasons, some areas of Meridian Sculpture will be off-limits during the workshops but a short tour of the foundry and the various processes will be offered at t he start of your course.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat's your cancellation policy? \u00a0\r\nPlaces are non refundable and any cancellations later than 48 hours prior to the course commencement will incur the full fee. With notice prior to 48 hours we are happy to modify the booking to allow attendance in an alternate class on another date or transfer to another name. We require a minimum number of participants for workshops to go ahead, should we be required to change dates or postpone our workshop you will be offered another date or a full refund.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nI'm still not sure it's right for me, can I speak to someone in more detail?\u00a0 \r\nOf course you can!

                "text": "HEAVY Magazine, Bear Parts Music & Wild Thing Presents\nCIRCLES - BALLARAT\nThe 'Winter' Tour - Australia & New Zealand 2019\nWith Special Guests:\u00a0Ebonivory\n\n\n\u00a0\nTo borrow a saying from a very popular TV show, \"WINTER IS COMING!\u201d. Melbourne bred progressive alternative rock juggernaut Circles are today announcing their \u2018Winter\u2019 Tour across Australian landscapes, and to the shores of New Zealand throughout July & August 2019, with a new music video for their single \u2018Winter\u2019 (off latest album The Last One) forthcoming as well. In addition, they are taking fellow Wild Thing Ballarat prog-punk sensation Ebonivory along for the ride. With each band\u2019s recent performances at PROGFEST 2019 completely breathtaking, and with Circles' live show one of the most powerful and mind blowing going around, this is a tour you definitely do not want to miss! \nThe tour lands in New Zealand first, where Auckland\u2019s post-alternative rock kings\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0will headline shows in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, then returns to Australia for\u00a0Circles\u2019 headline shows in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Belgrave, and Ballarat.\n2018 was a watershed year for\u00a0Circles, releasing their masterpiece album\u00a0The Last One\u00a0through\u00a0Wild Thing Records\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand and\u00a0Season Of Mist\u00a0internationally.\u00a0Louder\u00a0said that The Last One was \"...very much in a similar fashion to countrymen Karnivool, Circles have crafted a modern progressive tapestry with plenty of wider appeal thanks to songwriting nous coupled with their apparent technicality.\" They then joined\u00a0TesseracT\u00a0on their\u00a0Australian Tour in September\u00a0as special guests. Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast. Upon their return to Australia, they dazzled audiences on tour with\u00a0Dead Letter Circus\u00a0in December, before mesmerising\u00a0PROGFEST\u00a0in January 2019, with memorable performances as the festival\u2019s Australian headliner playing to full houses every night.\u00a0\nHailing from Ballarat in rural Victoria, Australia,\u00a0Ebonivory\u00a0creates an engaging mosaic of raw emotion, complex rhythmic devices, and prismatic melody. The world-class 5-piece ensemble employs a unique distillation of alternative rock, progressive metal, post-hardcore and modern punk, delivering a breathtaking performance that unifies musicians, melomaniacs, and casual listeners alike. Recently, they announced singing to\u00a0Wild Things Presents\u00a0for Management.\nABOUT CIRCLES\nThe Last One,\u00a0an album of tremendous power and lyrical inventiveness, delivers on the promise made on their\u00a0Basick Records\u00a0debut album\u00a0Infinitas\u00a0(2013).

Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This three-day workshop is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI have also developed my own four-pillars approach to teaching business and entrepreneurship skills. This workshop covers the first pillar.\u00a0\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0blogs\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.\nCan I claim CPD points?\nRegistered psychologists can claim up to eighteen hours of 'active' CPD. A certificate of attendance can be provided upon request.\u00a0",
