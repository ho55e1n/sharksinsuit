And, how to return them to send the right message. It is much easier than you might think!\" Fur Wale\n\nABOUT FUR WALE\n\nAt the young age of 10, Fur Wale felt very grown up. She made some of her most important decisions at that age.\u00a0Decisions such as not having children or getting married, as well as, not settling down with one person until she had fulley explored life and knew who she was.\nFur attributes this to her parents, who set the foundation for freedom of self expression and participation in family decisions. They would sit as a family unit once a week and when neccessary, with the intention of getting clear on matters relating to family decisions, thoughts and problems.\nFur recalls the day she got he period. Her Dad called the family together. He held her Mums hand as he smiled and talked to her two younger Brothers about the importance of being aware of my feelings and needs during these times.\nAt the age of 16 Furs middle brother began dating and her Dad had a conern about her not voicing anything about any romantic interests. He was concerned about the potential that his Daughter was possibly not interested in men, and may be gay. He didn't want this to be an issue for her.\nHe dealt with his concerns by setting up a date with a young man they both knew.\u00a0\u00a0She agreed even though she had no interest in dating anyone. She was simply enjoying her life, all wrapped up in art and sport and her friends. Because there was no communication around this, she thought that her Dad really wished for her to see what dating was like.\nThe young man was 18 so he drove to pick her up. She was extremely nervous so she appeared shy and awkward.\nThe young man took her to a fancy restaurant. He opend the door for her and pulled out the chair for her to sit, which only made her feel more awkward. As she scooped peas onto her fork, they all fell onto herself and the floor. As he lent across the table and touched her hand, she froze and stared at her half empty plate. He suggested they leave early. She felt herslf breath again!\nAs they took off in the car, she began to thank him out of politeness, for buying her dinner and for the ride. When she looked out the window, she came to realise thay they were heading the wrong direction to her home.\nFur was troubled by what to say about this. She didnt want to sound awkward or ungrateful but she wanted to go home. Instead, she sat outwardly silent to her inner struggle. Instead, she said \"Um, okay\" to a night cap upstairs in his apartment.\nSitting as far away from him on the couch as she possibly could, and poised frozen on he very edge hoping he'd get it that she wanted to go home, he sat right up next to her and kissed her cheek.\nHe then put his hand on her leg as he stated that he would bring them a drink. Fur drank her drink so fast, like her life depended on it. She wanted to get out of there. He was asking her to lie down in his bed with him.\nThe moment he told her \"Your'e moving too slow, it became intolerable and she blurred out \"Just take me home please!\"\u00a0\nFur came to realise that any mans advances that make you uncomfortable and quickly escalates to talking about or being 'sexual' are not appropriate under any circumstance.\nBecause of this experience, Fur chose to educate herself and become more experienced in the fundamental indicators of attraction and which behaviours indicate a 'gentleman' and those that say 'Im only interested in being sexual'.\nShe also held to her own standard and didn't get involved with or date until she felt the urge to at the age of 22.\nFur Wale now runs SHE Talks - Nonverbal Superpower to Meeting Mr Right (for you!) + outing.\n\"A quality man will respect and meet you at your desired level of comfort. Anyone who doesn't or pushes past your \"no\", has decided to fulfil their own needs whether sexually or otherwise. The moment someone tells you, your moving too slow, he's not a quality guy! The rule is, it's happening when both are ready, or not at all\" Fur Wale\nTESTIMONIAL\n\u201cFur Wale has been invited to speak and in-addition deliver inspirational workshops at many events with over 200 people, local Government, Mayor and Council in attendance.

And, how to return them to send the right message. It is much easier than you might think!\" Fur Wale</EM></DIV>\n<H3><BR></H3>\n<P><STRONG>ABOUT FUR WALE</STRONG></P>\n<DIV>\n<P>At the young age of 10, Fur Wale felt very grown up. She made some of her most important decisions at that age.\u00a0Decisions such as not having children or getting married, as well as, not settling down with one person until she had fulley explored life and knew who she was.</P>\n<P>Fur attributes this to her parents, who set the foundation for freedom of self expression and participation in family decisions. They would sit as a family unit once a week and when neccessary, with the intention of getting clear on matters relating to family decisions, thoughts and problems.</P>\n<P>Fur recalls the day she got he period. Her Dad called the family together. He held her Mums hand as he smiled and talked to her two younger Brothers about the importance of being aware of my feelings and needs during these times.</P>\n<P>At the age of 16 Furs middle brother began dating and her Dad had a conern about her not voicing anything about any romantic interests. He was concerned about the potential that his Daughter was possibly not interested in men, and may be gay. He didn't want this to be an issue for her.</P>\n<P>He dealt with his concerns by setting up a date with a young man they both knew.\u00a0\u00a0She agreed even though she had no interest in dating anyone. She was simply enjoying her life, all wrapped up in art and sport and her friends. Because there was no communication around this, she thought that her Dad really wished for her to see what dating was like.</P>\n<P>The young man was 18 so he drove to pick her up. She was extremely nervous so she appeared shy and awkward.</P>\n<P>The young man took her to a fancy restaurant. He opend the door for her and pulled out the chair for her to sit, which only made her feel more awkward. As she scooped peas onto her fork, they all fell onto herself and the floor. As he lent across the table and touched her hand, she froze and stared at her half empty plate. He suggested they leave early. She felt herslf breath again!</P>\n<P>As they took off in the car, she began to thank him out of politeness, for buying her dinner and for the ride. When she looked out the window, she came to realise thay they were heading the wrong direction to her home.</P>\n<P>Fur was troubled by what to say about this. She didnt want to sound awkward or ungrateful but she wanted to go home. Instead, she sat outwardly silent to her inner struggle. Instead, she said \"Um, okay\" to a night cap upstairs in his apartment.</P>\n<P>Sitting as far away from him on the couch as she possibly could, and poised frozen on he very edge hoping he'd get it that she wanted to go home, he sat right up next to her and kissed her cheek.</P>\n<P>He then put his hand on her leg as he stated that he would bring them a drink. Fur drank her drink so fast, like her life depended on it. She wanted to get out of there. He was asking her to lie down in his bed with him.</P>\n<P>The moment he told her \"Your'e moving too slow, it became intolerable and she blurred out \"Just take me home please!\"\u00a0</P>\n<P>Fur came to realise that any mans advances that make you uncomfortable and quickly escalates to talking about or being 'sexual' are not appropriate under any circumstance.</P>\n<P>Because of this experience, Fur chose to educate herself and become more experienced in the fundamental indicators of attraction and which behaviours indicate a 'gentleman' and those that say 'Im only interested in being sexual'.</P>\n<P>She also held to her own standard and didn't get involved with or date until she felt the urge to at the age of 22.</P>\n<P>Fur Wale now runs SHE Talks - Nonverbal Superpower to Meeting Mr Right (for you!) + outing.</P>\n<P>\"A quality man will respect and meet you at your desired level of comfort. Anyone who doesn't or pushes past your \"no\", has decided to fulfil their own needs whether sexually or otherwise. The moment someone tells you, your moving too slow, he's not a quality guy! The rule is, it's happening when both are ready, or not at all\" Fur Wale</P>\n<H3><STRONG>TESTIMONIAL</STRONG></H3>\n<DIV>\u201cFur Wale has been invited to speak and in-addition deliver inspirational workshops at many events with over 200 people, local Government, Mayor and Council in attendance.

This song cycle is an intensely intimate and evocative exploration that draws together multiple strands of the Convent\u2019s history, performed by leading contralto Liane Keegan and the vibrant and versatile PLEXUS collective \u2013 comprising of Monica Curro (violin), Philip Arkinstall (clarinet), and Stefan Cassomenos (piano).\nStories both light and dark will be woven together in an abstract narrative that tells the moving account of life for the various girls and women inhabiting the Convent during its period as a monastic site (1863 \u2013 1975). Sykes herself was a child at the Convent, and interviewed over seventy people to research her book of poems. Aronowicz and Sykes have worked closely together to convey the incredible emotional weight and social significance of these stories, introducing a new perspective for visitors of the site.\nThis performance will mark the premiere of the work that will then be launched as a free podcast, available to all visitors of the Convent. The evening will also involve an interview and discussion with Patricia Sykes about the process of adapting the poetry for musical setting.\nPlease noteAbbotsford Mysteries is presented in partnership with the Abbotsford Convent Foundation.

                "text": "Get Ready to Experience 2 days like Never Before and See your Life TRANSFORM!\n\nDiscover through innovative education, techniques and processes the ability to free yourself from any perceived negative cycles and patterns that have been holding you back, and finally start living your EXTRAORDINARY LIFE.\nIt is said that we should\u00a0\u2018work\u00a0harder on ourselves than on our jobs\u2019. So, let us ask you. When was the last time you took 2 days out to work solely on you, in a supportive and nurturing environment?\nChange is possible. You can experience your extraordinary life. There is only one thing getting in the way of this, and that one thing is YOU!\nYour ability to live your heart\u2019s desires begins with you taking time to understand and gain perspective on the patterns, beliefs, and perceived negative cycles that have held you back.\nWhen would\u00a0NOW\u00a0be a good time to start?\nHave you ever asked yourself, \u2018How am I here, AGAIN?\u2019 Are you noticing repeating cycles and patterns in your life, whether relationships, work, money, etc. that are not serving you? Are you finding yourself resisting or pushing away something, only to find you are having the very same experience you are trying to resist or push away?\nKnow that you are not alone!\nThere is a feeling deep within all of us, a movement to discover inner fulfilment and happiness. It begins with a motivating thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to change my life!\u2019 and then we start reading the \u2018self-help\u2019 books, going to seminars and workshops, listening to others, and with determination, declare that this time it will be different; This time, we will find our inner happiness, only for someone or something to interrupt our determination and motivation, our striving for our own fulfilment and happiness, and we find ourselves back where we started, frustrated, confused and we give up. Ultimately, we fall back into our old patterns and cycles, and exist in a life where we feel we have no choice.\nThe truth is, there is a purpose behind every experience we have, there is something it is trying to tell us.\u00a0 However, if we don\u2019t stop and gain clarity on what the experiences (the cycles, the patterns, etc.), are trying to tell us, we will continue to attract them into our lives.\nAre you prepared to continue repeating these patterns in the hope that someday they just stop? Or are you going to act to work on you, so that you have clarity, understanding and the ability to make new, profound choices that lead to fulfilment, joy, and happiness?\nTrue fulfilment begins with you. It is an inner journey of discovery and loving ALL aspect of self. It is beyond the programming of the past. It is discovering who you really are. It is LOVE.\n\nWhat can you do?\nTrue transformation occurs when you have clarity around the perceptions you hold in every area of your life, and this begins with you making a commitment to yourself, for yourself!\nOur reality is created from the perceptions that were formed before the age of 8, and these perceptions are based on life\u2019s experience. We created a model of the world in which we could make sense of all that was going on around and for us, and we continue to live out this model, which is the only reason we continue to find ourselves living in our cycles and patterns.\nWe cannot change what happened, but we can gain clarity around the experiences, and perceive them differently. You can affect change in your life and create a life aligned with your hearts desires, and literally live an extraordinary life.\nWe are here to evolve, and we can only do that by doing the inner work, shifting our perceptions, gaining clarity, and understanding and creating a life that you love.\nAt THE RESET EXPERIENCE\u00ae, Dee Littlewood will be your guide on your own personal transformational journey of discovery.\nWe will guide you through the Journey of a full quantum experience,\u00a0 based upon the Universal Laws and Principles, and together we will practice daily rituals designed to integrate these principles into your life.\nWhat\u2019s Included:\n\n\n2 Full Day Immersion into your own personal Reset Experience\n\n\nLetting It Go Graduation Fire Ceremony\n\n\nAmazing crew with amazing support!\n\n\nFun, health, and healing!\n\n\nTea / Coffee provided\n\n\n\nThis unique experience can be yours, when you are ready to:\n\n\nUnderstand your life lessons\n\n\nBreak Free from self sabotaging cycles that hold you back\n\n\nClear the perceptions and beliefs that have been unconsciously driving your behaviour\n\n\nLearn how to create new neural pathways to lasting change.\n\n\nOvercome present or past challenges or emotions\n\n\nResolve relationship issues\n\n\nTransform self-destruction, anxiety or depression\n\n\nGrow your self-worth and gratitude\n\n\nLive an inspired, purposeful, empowered and meaningful life\n\n\nSet, plan and achieve your meaningful goals and intentions\n\n\nDissolve volatile emotions that may be running your life\n\n\nClarify your vision and purpose\n\n\nTransform what you currently perceive as \u2018in the way\u2019 to \u2018on the way\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Reset Experience is a complete program\u00a0 for individuals who wish to deepen their\u00a0connection with the Self and gain a full quantum perspective\u00a0 around their perceptions and beliefs, which hold them back from achieving their potential. This program will help you come to a place of understanding and acceptance of the Self as a whole and perfect being and assist you to overcome all that no longer serves you.\u00a0The program puts in to perspective the Universal Laws and assists you to tap in to the Universal Energy so that you may connect with your higher (true) Self to receive love and guidance on your Soul Purpose. \u00a0Once you understand and live according to these teachings you will have the power to manifest abundance in any area of your life.\nThe key to Perspective is to find harmony and peace for the inner Self and to then align your outer self to reflect this new understanding. Remove the boundaries and limitations set by society and accept responsibility for your own experience by embracing your infinite power and rejecting powerlessness.\nDuring the two days of The Reset Experience, Dee Littlewood will guide you through the following:\nPerceptions, Values and Emotions\nDiscover how perceptions define values and emotions and what drives both you and the people around you. Learn the art of effective communication, creation of boundaries and gain the results you want in your relationships. Uncover your values and learn what is truly important in your life.\nClear Blocks and Self-Limiting Beliefs\nDee will guide you through the 4 core areas (or bodies) of life, (mental, emotional, physical, spiritual), to learn how to clear the blocks and self-limiting beliefs that prevent you from being fully empowered in all these areas and discover strategies to wake up and expand your own evolution\nDissolve volatile emotions and overcome challenges\nThrough Innovative processes and the Reset Process\u00ae, Dee will work through your perceptions to balance your emotions which will result in reduced stress, tension and anxiety. It will assist to break through your challenges and transform whatever is perceived as \u2018in the way\u2019 to \u2018on the way\u2019.\nDefining & Planning how you would love your life to be\nLearn how to fill your day with exactly what inspires you. Learn how to dissolve fears, overcome feelings of guilt, boost your potential and set value-based goals and Intentions. \u00a0Become clear on what you would love to be, do and have and map out your inspired vision and mission\nYour 2-Day Self-Investment & Lifetime Return\nINVESTMENT\nNew ClientAUD 1,497 pp\nResit ClientAUD $747 pp\nCouplesAUD 2,497 (2 ppl)\n\nWHO SHOULD ATTEND THE RESET EXPERIENCE\n\n\nAnyone wanting to know how to overcome challenges and adversity\n\n\nAnyone seeking to improve their relationships\n\n\nAnyone wanting to dissolve emotions like shame, guilt, fear, stress anxiety, rage, anger, resentment or any emotion that ages and stresses the body\n\n\nAnyone with health challenges seeking to dissolve anger and feelings of helplessness relating to illness?\n\n\nParents and teachers seeking to understand how to inspire and empower children?\n\n\nAnyone interested in understanding how the human mind works and the mechanisms which drive their behaviour?\n\n\nWe are here to help you understand and accept what your True Self has always known.

There is only one thing getting in the way of this, and that one thing is YOU!</P>\n<P>Your ability to live your heart\u2019s desires begins with you taking time to understand and gain perspective on the patterns, beliefs, and perceived negative cycles that have held you back.</P>\n<P><STRONG>When would\u00a0<SPAN>NOW</SPAN>\u00a0be a good time to start?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Have you ever asked yourself, \u2018How am I here, AGAIN?\u2019 Are you noticing repeating cycles and patterns in your life, whether relationships, work, money, etc. that are not serving you? Are you finding yourself resisting or pushing away something, only to find you are having the very same experience you are trying to resist or push away?</P>\n<P><STRONG>Know that you are not alone!</STRONG></P>\n<P>There is a feeling deep within all of us, a movement to discover inner fulfilment and happiness. It begins with a motivating thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to change my life!\u2019 and then we start reading the \u2018self-help\u2019 books, going to seminars and workshops, listening to others, and with determination, declare that this time it will be different; This time, we will find our inner happiness, only for someone or something to interrupt our determination and motivation, our striving for our own fulfilment and happiness, and we find ourselves back where we started, frustrated, confused and we give up. Ultimately, we fall back into our old patterns and cycles, and exist in a life where we feel we have no choice.</P>\n<P>The truth is, there is a purpose behind every experience we have, there is something it is trying to tell us.\u00a0 However, if we don\u2019t stop and gain clarity on what the experiences (the cycles, the patterns, etc.), are trying to tell us, we will continue to attract them into our lives.</P>\n<P>Are you prepared to continue repeating these patterns in the hope that someday they just stop? Or are you going to act to work on you, so that you have clarity, understanding and the ability to make new, profound choices that lead to fulfilment, joy, and happiness?</P>\n<P>True fulfilment begins with you. It is an inner journey of discovery and loving ALL aspect of self. It is beyond the programming of the past. It is discovering who you really are. It is LOVE.</P>\n<P><IMG ALT=\"reflective person\" SRC=\"https://infinityevents.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reflective-person.jpg\"></P>\n<P><STRONG>What can you do?</STRONG></P>\n<P>True transformation occurs when you have clarity around the perceptions you hold in every area of your life, and this begins with you making a commitment to yourself, for yourself!</P>\n<P>Our reality is created from the perceptions that were formed before the age of 8, and these perceptions are based on life\u2019s experience. We created a model of the world in which we could make sense of all that was going on around and for us, and we continue to live out this model, which is the only reason we continue to find ourselves living in our cycles and patterns.</P>\n<P>We cannot change what happened, but we can gain clarity around the experiences, and perceive them differently. You can affect change in your life and create a life aligned with your hearts desires, and literally live an extraordinary life.</P>\n<P>We are here to evolve, and we can only do that by doing the inner work, shifting our perceptions, gaining clarity, and understanding and creating a life that you love.</P>\n<P><STRONG>At THE RESET EXPERIENCE</STRONG><STRONG>\u00ae</STRONG><STRONG>, Dee Littlewood will be your guide on your own personal transformational journey of discovery.</STRONG></P>\n<P>We will guide you through the Journey of a full quantum experience,\u00a0 based upon the Universal Laws and Principles, and together we will practice daily rituals designed to integrate these principles into your life.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What\u2019s Included:</STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>2 Full Day Immersion into your own personal Reset Experience</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Letting It Go Graduation Fire Ceremony</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Amazing crew with amazing support!</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Fun, health, and healing!</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Tea / Coffee provided</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG><EM>This unique experience can be yours, when you are ready to:</EM></STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Understand your life lessons</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Break Free from self sabotaging cycles that hold you back</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Clear the perceptions and beliefs that have been unconsciously driving your behaviour</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Learn how to create new neural pathways to lasting change.</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Overcome present or past challenges or emotions</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Resolve relationship issues</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Transform self-destruction, anxiety or depression</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Grow your self-worth and gratitude</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Live an inspired, purposeful, empowered and meaningful life</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Set, plan and achieve your meaningful goals and intentions<I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I></P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Dissolve volatile emotions that may be running your life</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Clarify your vision and purpose<I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I></P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Transform what you currently perceive as \u2018in the way\u2019 to \u2018on the way\u2019</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><IMG ALT=\"Reset 3\" SRC=\"https://infinityevents.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reset-3.jpg\"></P>\n<P>The Reset Experience is a complete program\u00a0 for individuals who wish to deepen their\u00a0connection with the Self and gain a full quantum perspective\u00a0 around their perceptions and beliefs, which hold them back from achieving their potential.

You can affect change in your life and create a life aligned with your hearts desires, and literally live an extraordinary life.</P>\n<P>We are here to evolve, and we can only do that by doing the inner work, shifting our perceptions, gaining clarity, and understanding and creating a life that you love.</P>\n<P><STRONG>At THE RESET EXPERIENCE</STRONG><STRONG>\u00ae</STRONG><STRONG>, Dee Littlewood will be your guide on your own personal transformational journey of discovery.</STRONG></P>\n<P>We will guide you through the Journey of a full quantum experience,\u00a0 based upon the Universal Laws and Principles, and together we will practice daily rituals designed to integrate these principles into your life.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What\u2019s Included:</STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>2 Full Day Immersion into your own personal Reset Experience</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Letting It Go Graduation Fire Ceremony</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Amazing crew with amazing support!</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Fun, health, and healing!</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Tea / Coffee provided</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG><EM>This unique experience can be yours, when you are ready to:</EM></STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Understand your life lessons</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Break Free from self sabotaging cycles that hold you back</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Clear the perceptions and beliefs that have been unconsciously driving your behaviour</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Learn how to create new neural pathways to lasting change.</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Overcome present or past challenges or emotions</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Resolve relationship issues</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Transform self-destruction, anxiety or depression</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Grow your self-worth and gratitude</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Live an inspired, purposeful, empowered and meaningful life</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Set, plan and achieve your meaningful goals and intentions<I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I></P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Dissolve volatile emotions that may be running your life</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P><I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I>Clarify your vision and purpose<I CLASS=\"share icon\"></I></P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Transform what you currently perceive as \u2018in the way\u2019 to \u2018on the way\u2019</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><IMG ALT=\"Reset 3\" SRC=\"https://infinityevents.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reset-3.jpg\"></P>\n<P>The Reset Experience is a complete program\u00a0 for individuals who wish to deepen their\u00a0connection with the Self and gain a full quantum perspective\u00a0 around their perceptions and beliefs, which hold them back from achieving their potential.
