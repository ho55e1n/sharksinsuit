The plans in which the intra- and interpersonal needs of the stakeholders have been considered.\u00a0\nWhat can I learn in the workshop?\n1- In the workshop, you will undertake a self-scorable personality assessment called\u00a0Myers Briggs Type Indicator\u00a0(MBTI). This will help you to learn deeply\u00a0about your own personality preferences (e.g. preference for extraversion or introversion). You will discover your own personality type code and will learn about the other codes.\u00a0\n2- In the workshop, you will undertake a self-scorable personality assessment called\u00a0Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior\u2122\u00a0(FIRO-B). This will help you to learn deeply about your own interpersonal needs (e.g. inclusion, control). You will discover your own FIRO-B profile code and will learn about the other codes.\n3-\u00a0You will learn how to use personality as a leverage in engaging and consulting with others as well as learning how to create a balance between your own intra- and interpersonal needs and those of your stakeholders.\u00a0\n4- You will learn how to consider\u00a0intra- and interpersonal needs of your stakeholders when designing,\u00a0developing and delivering stakeholders' engagement/consultation plans.\u00a0\nHow the workshop is structured?\nIn three parts. Initially, you will undertake both assessments. You will then learn about the assessment methods, their applications, and your own profile codes. Finally, you will learn a\u00a0broad and diverse range of personality-based strategies for effective stakeholders' engagement and consultation.\u00a0\nThe workshop will include several group activities. You will find these activities very engaging and joyful!\u00a0\u00a0\nWho is the trainer?\nDr. Paul Hedayati will be your trainer and the workshop facilitator. Paul is a qualified trainer and a certified MBTI and FIRO-B administrator. He has delivered personality-related training workshops for over 200 people. Based on the feedback received, over 90% of the participants have found the workshops useful or very useful.\u00a0\nPaul has over 10 years hands-on experience in public engagement and consultation. He has served in the roles involving community/industry engagement and consultation at the United Nations (the UNDP), NSW Government, and VIC Government. Paul has received multiple awards and recognition certificates in these roles.\u00a0\nWhat else would be good to know?\nThe costs of the assessment forms, one MBTI booklet, and one FIRO-B booklet are included in the workshop's ticket price. These items collectively worth over $200. You will pay no extra money for them.",

In a day where my efforts go unnoticed by either my boss, kids or husband, I feel accomplished in a completion of a project. On a day where I may feel withdrawn and not in the mood to talk to anyone, crochet calms me and allows me to see the beauty in my yarn creation. It provides me with a community of like-minded individuals and allows for bragging rights and excitement in ideas for a new creation. Crochet gives me the \"ME\" time I so desperately crave when the boys are fighting and bickering. It gives me an opportunity to create masterpieces for loved ones. I show my appreciation for people through my hand-made items. I now appreciate the act of giving even more so!  In a time where life moves so quickly, crochet allows it to slow down and appreciate the smaller things.  So where will these classes take place?  In a relaxed environment at my house in Berwick, Victoria over tea/coffee and bickies with some other women all interested in learning some new skills.  What will you learn?  To crochet!!!!  Well, it may not mean that much at the moment but you will learn:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to read labels on yarn \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What yarn to choose for which projects \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are hook sizes and tension important? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to read a pattern \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to change colours mid-project \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to work in the round \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to work in rows \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adding a border to your work \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Different Stitches \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blocking  Will I make anything?

Baby/Lap Blanket  Cost?  $220 for all yarn, printed patterns, a set of aluminium hooks to take home, scissors and stitch markers, not to mention the 6 x 2 hr lessons with myself and my 20+ years of experience.

Suitable for all skill levels, beginners will step through core skills, and those with more experience will be pushed to the next level.\nYou will first draw your own art pieces to prepare for the batik classes, and then learn a series of batik techniques before coming back to stitch, sew, embellish and embroider the whole project together in the last two sessions, to produce a collective wall hanging that reflects the diverse experiences of our community.\nBook only once for the whole 6-week course. Participants are required to attend at least 5 of the 6 sessions in their group.

In this presentation, I will describe an approach to space/time-explicit quantification across three domains: globe, national, urban.
