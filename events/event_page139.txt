Please note, this is not an online talk or webinar. It is being held in Scoresby, Victoria, Australia.\nThe Presenter:\nPresented by Lee Wilson, a disability access consultant with Melbourne Access Audits.\u00a0In early 2018 he was appointed\u00a0as a volunteer Subject Matter Expert (Disability Access) by\u00a0the Australian Building Codes Board.\u00a0\n\nLee has been actively campaigning for a universal design approach in buildings for several years and published numerous articles, a guidebook and a white paper on accessible egress concepts.\u00a0\nSeminar Timings:\n09:00 am to 09:15 am - Arrivals, networking, introductions\n09:15 am to 10:45 am - The presentation and workshop\n10:45 am to 11:00 am - Question time\nSeminar Content:\nTopics discussed during the presentation will help:\n\nUnderstand the different types of design options available on accessible paths of travel when moving between two levels, including walkways, kerb ramps, step ramps, threshold ramps, pool access ramps, 1:14 ramps and fire-isolated ramps\nUnderstand the different types of stairs that can be used to move between floor levels (fire-isolated, exit, pool, and general use communication)\nIdentify slip-resistance rating requirements\nImplement risk reduction and best-practice recommendations\nDetermine when an area of a building (including a stair) might be exempted\nIdentify luminance contrast requirements\nConsider compliance options (i.e Performance Solutions and Deemed-to-Satisfy)\n\nCase studies will be discussed and there will be 15 minutes for questions and open discussion at the end of the presentation.\nIdeally, please complete the session 'Understanding the Basics of Access' before attending this training. Or have a basic understanding of the building code and disability Premises Standards.\nThere is an onsite cafe for those needing an expresso coffee or breakfast before the presentation.\nFAQs:\nWho should attend?\nThis seminar is suitable for people of all backgrounds and professions. It is designed as an entry-level introduction to the concept of accessibility of stairs, ramps, and other graded accessways (pathways) in relation to buildings and premises.\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nThe building is conveniently located off the Eastlink (take the BP Service Centre exit).\nThere are external car parking areas to the east of the building (off Lakeview Drive) and to the west (in front of the adjoining buildings, 35 and 37 Dalmore Drive). The best accessible car parking spaces are located in front of\u00a035 and 37 Dalmore Drive. There are no undercover accessible car parking spaces.\nIf you are coming from the city via public transport, take the train to Glen Waverley, then catch the 753 bus to\u00a0Nyadale\u00a0Drive (and then it is a 2km walk to the office building though).\nIs the building wheelchair accessible?\nYes, it is a newly constructed office building with all accessible entrances, passenger lift, left-hand and right-hand configuration accessible toilets. However, avoid the eastern external car parking area if you have any difficulties using a stair (as above, use the car park\u00a0in front of\u00a035 and 37 Dalmore Drive).\nWhere is the training room located?\nThe training room is on the ground floor of the Waterman Business Centre.\u00a0The room is called The Laneway Boardroom. The photo below is the view as you arrive at the ground floor lobby area. If you walk down past the reception area, the training room is at the end of the internal laneway. See you there.\n\n\nDoes the room have hearing augmentation provided?\nNo, there will also be no amplified sound used during the presentation. The room is a relatively small meeting room for 18 people.\u00a0But if you would like us to organise a portable hearing loop system please let us know we can organise this for you.\nWill any videos be open captioned?\nThere are no videos for this presentation.\u00a0If you have any additional accessibility needs please contact our office.\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nSorry, strictly no refunds.",
