Many of our attendees have had positives meetings as a result of coming to Connect and partnerships have developed as a result. Not only can you meet a new person or business but you often find out something new about the people you already know because you stopped to talk about your business and focus on it for an hour. Regularly people have come to Jindabyne Connect and come away with a business opportunity.\n\n\u00a0\nSecondly the pitches are designed to be a way for a business to highlight themselves through asking for help from the community, bringing an opportunity or challenge to the community, a need for partnership or new challenge from an experience that the business has had. It is not about pure business promotion but a good pitch and a good idea will promote you and your business.\n\n\u00a0\nThirdly we try to include a speaker from Council, NSW Government, or Federal Government or other government bodies such as BEC or RDASI each month. This gives you the opportunity to interact with these representatives, ask questions and get information on what they are doing for the business community. That may be a business evaluation program, a council development, upcoming strategy in town, a grant that is available for applications or a new business program.\n\n\u00a0\nFinally, you get what you put in, so if you turn up with business cards, ready to engage, ask questions and see what you can find out, you might find a partner or new customer \u2013 that\u2019s a good outcome for an hour of your time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Speaking & SponsorshipWe average an attendance of 30-35 each month, and are growing, so come along and talk about your business. \n\n\nConnect events are available for sponsorship by a local business to provide more exposure to the audience, and to help cover the costs of drinks and nibbles. \n\n\u00a0\nIf you would like to speak or sponsor this event please contact Duncan Isaksen-Loxton 0416 325 673 to book in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0About\nJindabyne Connect is an initiative of the Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce, Snowy Monaro Regional Council and Ausindustry with the goal of developing, growing and supporting our business community.\n\u00a0\n",

Some with medical savoir-faire have suggested he'd been singing in Utero, yet he only speaks English and French...\nLast year, Jared had an anus magnificus. Following a sold-out return to the cabaret stage, he made what many have called an hilarious television debut on Seven's All Together Now.\u00a0This increased his Twitter following by 11. Never one to rest on his cockscombs, he\u00a0followed this up with a guest spot in Dolly Diamond's Christmas Cabaret in Magnificent Melbourne, and is now thrilled to have The Butterfly Club present the Victorian Premi\u00e8re of his deeply personal, tragically true show, SupercalifragilisticOsteoporosis.\n\n\n\"I don't really care if he can sing, I just love him!\" \u2013\u00a0Gogglebox\n\"Who?\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Ethel Merman\n\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nThe Butterfly Club is a licensed venue. Accordingly, patrons under 18 are only allowed on premises in the company of a parent or legal guardian.\n\u00a0\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nWe strongly encourage using public transport. The Butterfly Club is a short stroll from Flinders Street station and Melbourne Central, and an even shorter stroll from any tram that travels through Swanston or Collins Streets (get off at Town Hall).\nIf driving, you can find the best parking rates in the area by visiting carparking.info (link opens in a new window).\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the venue with any questions?\nPlease call The Butterfly Club on 03 9663 8107 or visit our box office (the first room as you enter the Club) from 5pm to 8:30pm Monday to Saturday.\n\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nThere are no refunds or exchanges. Exceptions are made in extraordinary circumstances at the Club's discretion: if there is a sensible reason why you should receive a refund, please contact us and we'll be happy to discuss.\n\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nNo. We have a full record of all attendees and will be able to let you in whether you bring a printed copy of your ticket or not.\n\u00a0\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?\nYes.\n\u00a0",

                "text": "Jack Gray\u00a0Nights Like This EP TourFri. June 28, 2019The Grace Darling HotelGuests TBA\n----\n\u201cI don\u2019t think of music in terms of genre,\u201d says Jack Gray. \u201cI grew up listening to everything, so I feel like that sets the table for me as a songwriter.\u201d\nTake a listen to Gray\u2019s captivating debut EP, \u2018Nights Like This,\u2019 and you\u2019ll understand exactly what he means. Blurring the lines between pop charisma, R&B swagger, and rock and roll propulsion, the collection showcases the young Australian\u2019s deft hand as both a writer and producer, one with a preternatural knack for infectious hooks and emotionally resonant arrangements. Gray sings with a seemingly effortless intimacy, his easygoing demeanor often belying the relentless work ethic and minute attention to detail that goes into each of his tracks. Calling to mind contemporaries from Jack Garratt and James Blake to Frank Ocean and The 1975, his productions show little regard for traditional distinctions between acoustic and electronic elements, frequently combining both into an ambitiously modern blend that feels instantly familiar and boldly adventurous all at once.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m making beats, I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m using an 808 drum machine or an acoustic kit,\u201d explains Gray, who plays most every instrument on the EP himself. \u201cIf it sounds dope, I say let\u2019s run with it and see where it goes.\u201d\nThat up-for-anything attitude has helped fuel Gray\u2019s success from the start. Just a few short years ago, the Queensland native was studying music at a conservatory in Brisbane when he received an unexpected invitation.\n\u201cThis manager from Sydney reached out over email and said they heard my stuff online and wanted to record me,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI decided to just go for it.\u201d\nThose recordings landed Gray a development deal with Warner Music, who quickly added him to the famed 50 Songs In 5 Days songwriting camp in order to meet collaborators. Gray made such an impression on the team from event organizers Specific Music that they offered him a publishing deal on the spot.\nThough Gray had suddenly gone from student to major label breakout star-in-the-making, his creative approach remained largely unchanged. He continued to work primarily in his bedroom, writing and recording by himself or with friends for the sheer joy of it, just as he had since childhood.\n\u201cMy dad raised me as a musician,\u201d Gray reflects. \u201cHe was a drummer, and my whole family played instruments, so I was surrounded by music growing up. I started off playing drums, guitar, piano, and bass, but when I finished high school, I got a laptop and started teaching myself how to produce in Logic. That software became like another instrument in and of itself for me. I was obsessed with it.\u201d\nGray would put in countless days and nights fine-tuning his material, often writing the skeleton of a song in a quick burst of inspiration before producing as many as a dozen different versions of the track in search of the perfect vibe.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll spend a stupid amount of hours on the same song,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little recording setup right next to my bed, so I can work for a bit and then lay down and listen over and over again until I get it just right. I\u2019m a perfectionist, but working on my debut meant that I had the luxury of taking my time until everything was exactly the way I wanted it to be.\u201d\nWhen not working in his bedroom, Gray often found himself working out of \u201cGracevan,\u201d a caravan studio that his publishers set up on the beach in the small community of Fingal Head, just north of Byron Bay in Australia.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing creative space because you could be in the studio all day, but the beach is right outside your door,\u201d says Gray. \u201cIf I lose inspiration, I can head out for a swim or a beer to clear my head. I\u2019m my own producer and engineer and band, so I don\u2019t have to follow anyone\u2019s schedule.\u201d\nIt was in the caravan that Gray penned some of his earliest singles, including \u201cRed Rental Car\u201d and \u201cMy Hands,\u201d which earned him extensive international tour dates with multi-platinum Australian star Dean Lewis and collectively racked up more than two million streams on Spotify alone. While the singles made for a great introduction to his music, Gray was ready to tackle something a little larger with the EP, assembling a collection of songs written and recorded over the past two years that reflected his remarkable growth as an artist and producer.\n\u201cI\u2019ve finally gotten my songs to a point where they sound like what I\u2019ve heard in my head for so long,\u201d says Gray. \u201cThat\u2019s how I knew it was the right time for this EP.\u201d\nCapturing all the beautiful highs and messy lows of the journey into adulthood, the songs on \u2018Nights Like This\u2019 often juxtapose conflicting emotions, tackling weighty topics with subtle nuance and thoughtful reflection. \u201cDown Side of Up\u201d is a fast-paced sugar rush that clocks in at less than two-and-a-half frenetic minutes as it balances optimism and pessimism, while the slow-burning \u201cTake Our Time\u201d builds from a hushed piano to a dreamy synth-scape in its exploration of fantasy and reality, and the soaring and powerful \u201cBullet\u201d examines human connection and loss in the face of depression and isolation. Perhaps it\u2019s the radio-ready alt-pop gem \u201cFools,\u201d though, that\u2019s most indicative of Gray\u2019s artistry. Grappling with the pull of nostalgia and the push to move forward, the track would ultimately go through an elaborate series of revisions and re-imaginings before ever seeing the light of day, with fourteen alternate versions eventually giving way to its final form.\nIt was a long and winding evolution, but, as with everything Jack Gray does, the results are more than worth the journey.\n",
