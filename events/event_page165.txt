In this first part of the session we separate fact from fiction. We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.  Most importantly, we explain the process by which people decide to seek help for their drug\u00a0use and how families can support these decisions.\n  TOPIC 2: STRATEGIES\nBreakThrough isn\u2019t just about ice. We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.  Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.\n TOPIC 3: HELP\nThe last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones. We also look at some of the barriers to seeking help and how to overcome these.  All family members attending the workshop will be given information on where to get help and\u00a0support following the completion of the workshop and options for ongoing support activities.",

In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe.

In this course you will learn the true and correct methodology and apply it to your own programme to maximise business results. \r\nDuring this course you will learn the four levels, receive a participant manual filled with examples and templates that you may borrow and adapt to build your own tools, and gain a complete understanding of what each level measures. You will also explore the reasons why evaluation is critical to training success and hear case studies and success stories from companies that have used the model effectively.\r\nA unique feature of this course is the exploration of how to ensure that what is learned transfers to on-the-job behaviours. You will learn why training alone is not enough, and receive guidance to make sure that what you teach actually gets used on the job. \r\nYou will finish an action-packed, interactive course by creating an evaluation plan to ensure that your own learning transfers to on-the-job behaviours. On submission of your evaluation plan you will receive a grade and personalised comments - this will allow you to become bronze level certified.\r\nClick here to see the Programme explained by Jim and Wendy Kirkpatrick.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you will receive\r\n\r\nPre-work \r\nInteraction throughout the workshop\r\nWorkbook including templates, tools, and examples\r\nCopy of the book - Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Training Evaluation \r\nPost workshop assignments\r\nGrading and personalised feedback on your individual evaluation plan\r\nCertificate of completion and certification credential\r\nFour weeks of follow-up via email\r\nInformal consulting via phone/email for one year from date of certification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKirkpatrick Certification Package\r\n\r\n\r\nBecoming a Gold Level Kirkpatrick Certified Practitionerand making a real impact in the world of training and development\r\n\r\n$400 discount when committing to the Kirkpatrick process of certification.\r\n\r\nOur aim is for you to become a true strategic business partner, by creating and demonstrating the value and impact of training initiatives to your organisation's bottom line. To achieve this, the Kirkpatrick certification process of Bronze, Silver and Gold certification, takes you on a journey that culminates in professional recognition for you and your organisation\u2019s achievements.\r\nKirkpatrick Bronze Level certification provides you with the framework to develop a robust and stakeholder driven evaluation plan that will prepare you to maximise training's value and then demonstrate that value. Kirkpatrick Silver Level certification provides the structure and support you need to successfully implement your evaluation plan and the ability to demonstrate your results back to your stakeholders. Kirkpatrick Gold Level certification provides a way for you to share your accomplishments and the value created from your training initiatives with your community of practice through a presentation or publication. Throughout your journey you will have the on-going support of Kirkpatrick Certified Facilitators and Australasian Kirkpatrick Affiliates, David Dewhurst and Mark Harris.\r\n\r\nTo enable you to achieve this professional recognition we would like to offer a special discount of $400 off the cost of registration for Silver certification if made at the same time as registering for Bronze certification. This requires a deposit of $200 to be paid at the time of Bronze level registration but full payment for Silver is not required until you register for the actual workshop.

Your approach to learning and building relationships was truly living and breathing Kirkpatrick and you had me fully engaged.\r\nI spent most of Friday, unpacking Kirkpatrick\u2019s model for two of my colleagues and they were as excited as me about the possibilities. I even helped my husband to think through the steps to help him clarify a problem at his work! My Saturday afternoon was spent on a sun lounger devouring the book you gave me. Loved it!\r\nIt is rare to go on a course where the participants also inspire but that is what I experienced. Thanks to you all for sharing your great ideas and resource tips. Looking forward to keeping in touch.\"\r\nHeather Compton\r\nGlobal L&D Manager, Orion Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Kirkpatrick training has allowed me to see the \" bigger picture\" when delivering educational material. I am now asking management what the desired outcomes and leading indicators will be as a result of the education package. The Kirkpatrick Model has highlighted the importance of what happens following the education session and how we can best support changes in the workplace. I have also reviewed and made changes to my course material and evaluations, to link what students have learnt back to desirable workplace behaviours. I would recommend this programme to all learning and development staff and have found the GMD team ongoing support invaluable in helping me implement changes in my practice.\"\r\nLeah Caldwell\r\nClinical Educator\r\nSCDHB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"More than any other learning event in my time working in L&D, I feel that this will have immediate relevance and application to my work. I recommend this programme without hesitation, not only for Learning and Development Professionals, but even for General Managers and Executive Teams\"\r\n\r\nAndy Corbin,  L&D Programmes Developer, IHC. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"For me, the best thing about attending the Kirkpatrick Four Levels Evaluation programme was to be able to connect the dots. The programme takes a holistic and diagnostic approach which helps L&D professionals to establish connections between evaluation, Organisational Development, performance and engagement.\"\r\nAdrita Mukhopadhyay\r\nMinistry of Justice - Wellington\r\n\r\n\"I attended the two day Kirkpatrick training last year, and I suggest that it should be compulsory training for all Learning & Development practitioners! The course catered well for those new to the Kirkpatrick Model and also to those already familiar with the framework. In practical terms, not only did the course help us with developing a more robust evaluation process (beyond learner reactions), but also with a re-think of our entire approach to needs analysis, learning delivery and on the job support practices. Plus having Jim Kirkpatrick deliver this course with the GMD team was an absolute bonus.\"\r\nCarolyn Bates\r\nChristchurch City Council\r\n\r\n\"Being a HR professional I was quite skeptical about the benefit of this training for myself and the organisation I am working for at first. However, during the training I realised its full potential and how it could help us to improve our current processes and practices. From time to time in my work I would come across a situation where an employee was given all the possible training opportunities, but still failed to apply a learned skills and behaviours on a job. This training helped us to identify what we been missing and how to fix a problem.\r\nThe training was very inspirational, energising, bringing lots of ideas. I feel that all the techniques used, the methods, the powerpoint were extremely good. At no point did I feel that the training was \u201cdragging on\u201d. There was a lot of energy and enthusiasm not only from the facilitators but the training participants as we all were so engaged in what was happening in the room. It is great to have Kirkpatrick facilitators with so much energy. I felt challenged and consistently drawn into the exercises, discussions and presentations had my full attention due to the way in which they were conducted. Thank you a lot!\"\r\nMaryna Bilousova, Workforce Development Manager \r\nPact Group - Dunedin\r\n\r\n\"I attended the KP workshop in Christchurch last year hosted by GMD Partnerships. The workshop was of great value and I immediately made use of the tools and strategies taught to improve the value of my own training sessions for business clients around New Zealand. I highly recommend the workshop to those interested in ensuring that training returns a return on investment.\"\r\nMike Catton\r\nImpact Leadership - Christchurch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal testimonials\r\n\r\n\"The value the Kirkpatrick training provides not only pertains to evaluation, but to the entire training and instructional design process making it easier to identify true business needs and provide true business results. It's a wonderful model!\"\r\nIris NunnNunn Training and Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My opinion of the value of evaluation has been changed. I now see how the evaluation process and Kirkpatrick model are essential to both ensuring a proper start and successful ending to my interventions.\"\r\n\r\nDenny WardPeople Development Manager\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wendy took the time to listen intently to feedback that challenged the thinking and ideas. I did not feel that this was \"the Kirkpatrick way and that's all.\"\r\n\r\nSteve BallVale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This course really opened my eyes on how to get past Level 1 and 2 evaluations and center in on the behaviors and results aspect of making training relevant to the end user, and helping stakeholders realize its importance to mission readiness.\u201d\r\n\r\nBill HallBooz Allen Hamilton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is undoubtedly one of the most valuable trainings I've attended in a long time. We are now equipped with the appropriate tools to confidently evaluate our training programs. Thank you!\"\r\n\r\nMayda DownsCounty of San Diego - HHSA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My new knowledge has given me a passion to evaluate current and future programs to the appropriate level.\"\r\n\r\nPenelope RosePerrigo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Training with a purpose - tried and true - proven model.

For instructions,\u00a0click here.\n\n\n\nData literacy for everyone\nWith the advent of automation, humans\u2019 role has become to do what computers cannot. Many more white-collar workers\u2014perhaps all of them\u2014will end up \u201cworking with data\u201d to some extent.\nUsing data to provide insights and guidance that computers alone cannot requires \u201cdata literacy\u201d, which is doubly important for anyone working alongside, supporting, leading, or hiring a data-science and analytics team.\nData literacy involves a broad range of skills, including:\n\nan appreciation of the language of data\nunderstanding uncertainty (expressed as probabilities) and complexity\ninterpreting relationships in data (multivariate correlation) and visual representations of them\nreading visual representations of data\n\nIt also includes the ability to think rigorously and abstractly about evidence-based decision-making and manipulate data accordingly..\nThis course introduces a range of skills and applications related to critical thinking in such areas as forecasting, population measurement, set theory and logic, causal impact and attribution, scientific reasoning and the danger of cognitive biases.\nIt is highly recommended for managers and workers who have not had quantitative work as the basis of their career to date, and for many IT professionals. The main tool used will be Microsoft Excel, and other tools for data manipulation, analysis and visualisation will also be introduced. There are no prerequisites beyond high-school mathematics; this course has been designed to be approachable for everyone.\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people. Select your desired quantity of tickets and click \u201cAdd to cart\u201d to see the discount calculated before checkout.\nPlease contact us at enquiries@presciient.com to find out more about these special rates.\n\nCourse instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services \n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course.
