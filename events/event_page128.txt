                "text": "MASQUE EXPRESSIF is an Expressive Mask & Movement Workshop for actors, performers and theatre makers. \nThis 2 day weekend workshop is presented by mask teacher and mask maker Brenda Monaghan, who has been working with mask and physical theatre practices for over twenty years. \nMasque Expressif is held in Melbourne from\u00a027 to\u00a028 May 2019, at Dancehouse - 150 Princes St Carlton North VIC 3054.\nIn this workshop the expressive mask is used as a powerful tool for the actor to discover the potential of their body & its creative expression. The mask like a divine object, liberates the actor from mental limitations, transforming them into authentic and physically articulate characters far from their own personal experience. Through observing the mask and letting it live through their body the actor forgets themselves and embodies another.Working with mask is not about subtext or psychological work, it\u2019s about understanding their place in society, their relationship to the world, and how they respond to it. The mask is not directed from the mind, it\u2019s deeper work than that, it will denounce you if you try to direct it. The transformation comes from a spontaneous and truthful place within the actor and their embodiment of each mask is vastly different. There is great freedom and beauty in this work, it opens many doors of creative possibility and physical versatility.Participants will use quality full and half expressive masks, hand crafted by masters from around the world.\nJOURNEY: \n\u2022Exploring expressive potentials in the body \n\u2022Forgetting the self and incarnating the other. The mask is a catalyst for this powerful transformation. \n\u2022Bringing the body into harmony with the soul of the mask. \n\u2022Mask Improvisation \u2013 the pleasure of playing \n\u2022Discovering the voice of the mask \n\u2022Enriching characterisation and deepening emotional connection.\nDETAIL: \n\u2022Expressive movement training\u2014an introduction to refining sensitivity to qualities (essence) of movement and rhythm; responding on impulse; heightening kinesthetic and spatial awareness \n\u2022Improvised and structured play with Full mask \u2022Improvised and structured play with Half mask \u2022Counter-Mask \u2022Retrieval \u2013 identifying the physical pathways \n\u2022This workshop is an introduction to the work \n\u2022The masks used are quality masks from master mask makers from France, Bali, Italy and New Zealand.
