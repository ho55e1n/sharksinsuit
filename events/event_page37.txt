Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\u00a0\nNO RELIGION.

This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOU COURSE FACILITATOR IS COCO NKRUMAH\n\nCoco has been involved with mindfulness and meditation for over 10 years.
