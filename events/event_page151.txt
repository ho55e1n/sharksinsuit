Adopting software engineering best practices at the beginning of a project can address these problems, but this is often not done due to lack of time and/or experience. This workshop covers the essentials of good programming practices and provides you with tools and knowledge to build high quality bioinformatics software from the outset. We will introduce a tool for quickly creating new software projects with important features and infrastructure already included. You will use this tool to initialise a new project including a fresh repository on GitHub.\u00a0\r\nLearning Outcomes\r\nBy the end of the workshop you will have:\r\n- Created a new software repository - Committed it to GitHub - Set up continuous integration testing - Used test-driven-development to add a new feature to the program - Learnt about good practices in software development and why they are useful - Learnt how to use a tool (bionitio) to automate this for future projects.\r\nTarget audience\r\nBioinformaticians with beginner to intermediate level of programming experience who want to apply good software engineering practices in their daily work. Experience with the Unix command-line is assumed.

Business Owners.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout the Presenter\nHi, I believe that everyone is entitled to be the best version of themselves across the lifespan and in each domain of their lives. Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This seven-week workshop (plus bonus) is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five blogs (two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first workshop. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nWhat if I missed the starting date or it is fully booked out?\nSend Dr. Abramson an email (rachela@ozemail.com.au) and she will advise you when this workshop series is next offered.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.",

Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This seven-week workshop is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0blogs\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.\nWhat if I missed the starting date for this workshop?
