                "text": "Got space on your couch? \nThis isn\u2019t just a day to adopt greyhounds. If you are thinking about adopting and want to find out more information, this is a great opportunity as staff from the Greyhound Adoption Program will be on hand to answer any of your questions while you meet and interact with some of our placid, friendly greyhounds.  If you are interested in adopting on the day, please click here\u00a0and fill out the adoption application. The form needs to be filled out in addition to registering to attend the event.  When: Sunday, 28 April Time: 11:00 am to 3:00 pm Venue: The Meadows GRA   Registration for this event is essential. Register today via\u00a0the form above and see you and your family at the event! \n\n\n\nFAQs\nWhat can/can\u2019t I bring to the event? All you need is yourself!  Can I bring my pet dog with me? Unfortunately, we are unable to facilitate meetings between your current pet and potential greyhound so please leave them at home. If you would like your current pet to meet the potential new greyhound, please arrange this separately with GAP where you can do this at the Seymour or Baxter properties. Other arrangements may be able to be made if these two locations do not suit but you\u2019ll need to speak with GAP.  Will there be cat-tolerant greyhounds available for adoption? Unfortunately, due to these greyhounds being in high demand there won\u2019t be any cat-tolerant greyhounds available on the day for adoption. If you would like to adopt a cat-tolerant greyhound, please contact GAP directly on 03 5799 0166.  What greyhounds are up for adoption? In the week leading up to the event, we will publish the list of greyhounds that will be available on the day, which we will post on this page closer to the event. However, if you register prior to Thursday 26 April, you will also receive an email by Friday 27 April, with information regarding the day which includes the list of greyhounds available.  Can I have a greyhound held for me and just pick up on the day? We cannot hold a greyhound(s) for you. Remember every day is an Adoption Day at GAP, so if you don\u2019t get the greyhound you are looking for don\u2019t worry. There are more coming through the program on a weekly basis, so the right one will come along eventually, you just need to give it time.  What happens if I miss out on the day? Unfortunately, we can only transport a certain number of greyhounds to these events, therefore, with the popularity of them, there is a chance you will miss out on adopting a greyhound. It is important to remember though; every day is an Adoption Day at GAP. If you don\u2019t get the greyhound(s) you would like, don\u2019t forget there are more coming through the program on a weekly basis. The right greyhound will come along, it just may take some time so don\u2019t be discouraged.  Where can I contact the organiser with any questions? For more information please visit the GAP Adoption Days page on our website. You can also contact us at adoptionday@grv.org.au.  Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? Ideally, it would be great if you did but no, you don\u2019t need to bring your printed ticket. We can still check you in without it.",
