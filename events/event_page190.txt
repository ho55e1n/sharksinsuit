Using both plenary and group activities, we expect you to leave the workshop with a better understanding of what supervision of students means and the different models of learner supervision. You will discuss effective supervision and its outcomes, alongside barriers and enablers to effective supervision of students. You will also explore ways to evaluate supervision of students in your own health or human services contexts. The focus of this workshop will be on the formative (educational) functions of supervision and will cover the principles of experiential learning, reflective practice and feedback. We also draw on examples of supervising students interacting with clients under challenging circumstances such as those affected by methamphetamine.\r\nRoom:\r\nActivity rooms 1 and 2\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "Learn practical and immediate ways to bring more aliveness to your meetings, workshops, training and events.\r\nDo you have to deliver training or events with lots of content and information? Do you rely on Powerpoint slides, speakers, manuals, and Q and A? Are you a little bit bored with how you are facilitating? \r\nThis workshop for facilitators and trainers will give you practical ways of sharing information that keeps people engaged and interested. We'll also do some activities that enable people to share their own knowledge and experiences.\r\nAnd we'll share some facilitation tips: the problem with some room set-ups; the importance of finishing on time; avoiding the Plenary Vortex and Teacher Trance...\r\nThis is our foundation workshop where we share processes and activities to bring more aliveness to training and events so as\u00a0you can make the best use of people's time and energy. It complements the ideas in our book, Creative Facilitation, and offers hands-on learning in a small group.\r\n\r\nWho should attend?\r\nAnyone responsible for designing and leading training or events, especially where there's a lot of content to cover - whether it's internal, with clients, for consultation, feedback, generating ideas or learning. Anyone who is frustrated and a bit bored by existing approaches.\r\nWhat can I expect?\r\nYou'll be surprised by the variety and depth of ways to engage people, and you'll experience for yourself what each feels like. You'll share your reactions and insights with other professionals grappling with the same issues that you are. You'll spend very little time sitting down, a lot of time doing; and while our appraoches are grounded in behavioural science, you won't be bombarded with theory.\u00a0You'll leave with practical ideas to try at your next meeting or event.\u00a0\r\nWe will have different types of conversations, we\u2019ll look at different ways of looking at the same thing, we\u2019ll do activities, we\u2019ll use the space we\u2019re in, and the surroundings. It will be fun, and we'll sometimes challenge the conventions of training and facilitation.\r\nThere will be less formal structure than in conventional training; instead we'll be exploring how the whole group can create and shape the experience together - in some ways this is the metaskill of facilitation.\r\nThere will be lots of opportunities to share experiences, practice what you are learning and plan for lively events.\r\nWhat topics do you cover?\r\nBeyond traditional approaches\u00a0-\u00a0How to avoid the mistakes that traditional education teaches us about how people share, learn and interact.\r\nParticipatory approaches - Ways of sharing information, gathering ideas, and learning together that helps a group connect and engage with the content.\u00a0How to create an environment of open-ness and trust, and getting people to work together.\r\nBeyond words - How to get beyond wordy, and worthy, sometimes meaningless, words using photos, action and story.\r\nBravo! You as a performer\u00a0-\u00a0While the group, and the processes you use, are important, what about you? How do you deal with challenges, stage fright, a crisis of confidence? The second day of this workshop focuses on YOU and gives you tips and tools to manage yourself, especially when things go wrong.\u00a0\r\nYour hosts...\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN VIV AND JOHNNIE ARE CO-HOSTING THE WORKSHOP\r\nViv McWaters worked as a journalist, and in communications, and community education, training and strategy development. She now specialises in facilitation and participatory evaluation and draws on her background in the natural sciences and arts. Viv help groups discover new approaches to the work that matters for them, and designs workshops, conferences and training to bring them to life.\r\nViv studied agricultural science at Longerenong Agricultural College, and has a Bachelor of Arts in Media Studies from RMIT University, and a Masters in Applied Science (Agriculture and Rural Development) from the University of Western Sydney.\r\nImprovisation is a constant source of inspiration, as is nature, play and the surprising things that people say and do. Currently, Viv is researching the role of applied improvisation in preparing people to respond in uncertainty, particularly disaster response.\r\nJohnnie Moore has been a facilitator and coach for over fifteen years working with a wide range of organisations as far afield as Singapore and the Solomon Islands. Much of his focus is on helping people to have challenging conversations to create opportunities to learn and grow.\r\nHe is the co-founder of Creative Facilitation and also of Unhurried. He aims to bring humour, compassion and his own experiences of facing work and personal stress and challenge to his work with individuals and groups.\r\n\r\nPraise for Viv McWaters\r\n\"Highly recommended. It was a refreshing and energising experience, excellent for those both new to facilitation and those with more experience wanting to reconnect with the art of facilitation. Creative Facilitation reinforces a strengths-based approach to working with groups. Ego-less facilitation; masterfully designed and facilitated, thanks to Viv.\" Lindy Amos, Collective Possibilities\r\n\"The most exciting and useful training I've ever engaged in! It was interactive, informative and incredibly useful. I will use this whenever I facilitate a group to ensure the best learning outcomes are acheived for the group participants.\" Participant in NSW Health Training\r\n\"The greatest part of the Creative Facilitation workshop is the learning space Viv creates. Not only do you learn her facilitation methods and theory, you get to live and breathe them by participating in activities and experiencing them for yourself. So valuable.\" Melanie Starr, Northcote Rental Housing Cooperative\r\n\r\nThe Small Print\r\nGST of 10% is added to your registration fee.\r\nCost includes refreshments and lunch on both days.\r\nWe understand that sometimes plans change.
