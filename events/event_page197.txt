                "text": "This is a must attend seminar aimed at Oracle professionals (both DBAs and Developers) who are interested in Performance Tuning.\u00a0 The seminar will detail how to maximise the performance of both Oracle databases and associated applications and how to diagnose and address any performance issues as quickly and effectively as possible.\nWhen an application suddenly runs \u201cslow\u201d or when people start complaining about the \u201cpoor performance\u201d of the database, there\u2019s often some uncertainty in how to most quickly and most accurately determine the \u201croot\u201d cause of any such slowdown and effectively address any associated issues. In this seminar, we explore a Tuning Methodology that helps Oracle professionals to both quickly and reliably determine the actual causes of performance issues and so ensure the effectiveness of any applied resolutions.\nLooking at a number of real world scenarios and numerous actual examples and test cases, this seminar will show participants how to confidently and reliably diagnose performance issues. The seminar explores in much detail the various diagnostics tools and reports available in Oracle to assist in determining any database performance issue and importantly WHEN and HOW to effectively use each approach.\u00a0Additionally, participants are also invited to share their own database/SQL reports where we can apply the principles learnt in diagnosing the performance of their actual databases/applications\u00a0(we can communicate prior to the event on how to best get any reports of interest).\nOne of the more common reasons for poor Oracle performance is inefficient or poorly running SQL. This seminar explores in much detail how SQL is executed within the Oracle database, the various issues and related concepts important in understanding why SQL might be inefficient and the many capabilities and features Oracle has in helping to both resolve SQL performance issues and to maintain the stability and reliability of SQL execution.\nIt\u2019s a fun, but intense, content rich seminar that is suitable for people of all experiences (from beginners to seasoned Oracle experts).\n\nNote: Numbers are strictly limited due to the small class nature of the seminars. Please book early to avoid disappointment as seminars are not scheduled regularly.\n\nAll seminars include:\n\n\nDetailed course notes\n\n\nTea/Coffee\n\n\nLunch\n\n\n\u00a0\nSeminar Content (subject to minor change)\nSection One: Basic Tuning Concepts\n\n\nCommon (but flawed) Tuning Methodology\n\n\nTHE Correct Tuning Methodology\n\n\nImportance of Response Times\n\n\nImportance of Database Time and Concurrent Active Sessions\n\n\nIntroduction to Oracle Wait Interface\n\n\nThe Correct Mentality To Performance Tuning\n\n\nImportance Of Instrumentation\n\n\n\u00a0\nSection Two: Database Tuning\nIn Section Two, we explore how to best diagnose any performance issues as quickly as possible to accurately determine any root issue(s) and so apply the most appropriate resolutions. We explore a number of real world examples as well as providing the opportunity to go through any reports participants may wish to share.\nAs part of determining how to best resolve a number of real world examples, we get the opportunity to explore the internals of the database and the importance of understanding a number of crucial Oracle database concepts (e.g. latch contention, redo log mechanism, RAC cache fusion).\nBecause of the abundance of Oracle database instrumentation and the wealth of data available in (say) AWR Reports, many Oracle professionals feel swamped and are uncertain how to correctly read these types of reports when trying to diagnose a performance issue. In this section, we look at both WHEN and HOW to read the various reports to very quickly and reliably determine any performance issues and so know with certainty how to apply the most appropriate solution.\nWe explore the following Oracle supplied database diagnostics methods and when each of them are most appropriate to determine and resolve performance issues using a methodical tuning methodology:\n\n\nStatspack Reports\n\n\nAutomatic Workload Repository (AWR) Reports\n\n\nAutomatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) Reports\n\n\nActive Session History (ASH) Reports\n\n\n(Advanced) SQL Trace Files\n\n\n\u00a0\nSection Three: SQL Tuning\nOne of the most common reasons for poor performance is related to poorly running, inefficient SQL statements. In this section we explore in detail a number of important concepts and Oracle capabilities (up to and including Oracle Database 18c) in relation to maximising the performance and stability of SQL statements. Attendees will learn not only how to effectively tune SQL statements, but how to do so in a consistent manner to maximise both SQL performance and stability, by understanding how to determine the root cause of performance issues and hence implement the most appropriate solution to resolve any issues.\nTopics covered include:\n\n\nCBO Internals And How The CBO Costs SQL Statements\n\n\nWhy Is The More \u201cExpensive\u201d Costed SQL Often The Faster\n\n\nDifferences between ALL_ROWS and FIRST_ROWS(n) optimization\n\n\nSetting Optimizer Based Parameters\n\n\nCPU Cost Model and System Statistics\n\n\nSchema Statistics Gathering Tips\n\n\nHistogram Internals\n\n\nExtended Statistics and Virtual Columns\n\n\nDynamic Sampling\n\n\nDisplaying and Reading Execution Plans\n\n\nGATHER_PLAN_STATISTICS Hint\n\n\nManaging Outlier Data\n\n\nJoin Processing, Join Types and Join Methods\n\n\nAdaptive Query Optimization\n\n\nAdaptive Plans\n\n\nCardinality Feedback\n\n\nAdaptive Statistics\n\n\nSQL Plan Directives\n\n\nSQL Blocks\n\n\nSQL Transformations\n\n\n10053 Trace Report\n\n\nSQL Monitor Reports\n\n\nSQL Hints (and when/how to use appropriately)\n\n\nSQL Patching\n\n\nSQL Plan Stability\n\n\nSQL Profiles\n\n\nSQL Stored Outlines\n\n\nMigrating Stored Outlines to SQL Plan Management (Baselines)\n\n\nSQL Plan Management (Baselines)\n\n\nBaselines Use Cases\n\n\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nPlease email richard@richardfooteconsulting.com with any questions.\n\u00a0\nWhat's the refund policy?\nThere are no refunds if seminar proceeds.

Bookings are essential.\n\nMeet thriller author Tony Park as he discusses his latest novel \"Ghosts of the Past\".\nBased on a true story, 'Ghosts of the Past' tells the story of broken down journalist Nick Eatwell.\u00a0 Nick has just lost his job, but his day is brightened when a fellow reporter, South African Susan Vidler, comes into his life looking for his help with a story.\u00a0\nSusan is chasing information about Nick\u2019s great uncle, Cyril Blake, who fought in the Boer War and later joined a struggle for independence across the border in the German colony of South West Africa, now Namibia. A long-lost manuscript proves Nick\u2019s forebear was a somewhat reluctant hero. Soldier, deserter, cattle rustler and freedom fighter, Blake spent his last years on earth helping a lost cause before the Kaiser\u2019s forces ordered his assassination.\nIn Germany, historian Anja Berghoff is researching the origins of the famed desert horses of Namibia. She\u2019s also interested in Blake and an Irish-German firebrand and spy, Claire Martin, with whom Cyril had an affair. Nick and Anja head to Africa on the trail of a legend, but someone else is delving into the past, looking for clues to the secret location of a missing horde of gold - that\u2019s worth killing for.\nTony Park has worked as a reporter, a press secretary, a PR consultant and a freelance writer. He is also a Major in the Australian Army Reserve and served in Afghanistan in 2002. Tony and his wife divide their time between Sydney and southern Africa where they own a home on the border of the Kruger National Park. He is the author of fifteen novels set in Africa,\u00a0Far Horizon,\u00a0Zambezi,\u00a0African Sky,\u00a0Safari,\u00a0Silent Predator,\u00a0Ivory,\u00a0The Delta,\u00a0African Dawn,\u00a0Dark Heart,\u00a0The Prey,\u00a0The Hunter,\u00a0An Empty Coast,\u00a0Red Earth,\u00a0The Culland\u00a0Captive, and co-author of\u00a0Part of the Pride\u00a0(with Kevin Richardson),\u00a0War Dogs\u00a0(with Shane Bryant),\u00a0The Grey Man\u00a0(with John Curtis) and\u00a0The Lost Battlefield of Kokoda\u00a0and\u00a0Walking Wounded\u00a0(with Brian Freeman).\u00a0\nTony is a keen supporter of several charities concerned with wildlife and people in Africa. He is a Patron of Painted Dog Conservation Inc, a charity supporting the endangered African Painted Dog. Tony welcomes the opportunity to talk about Africa, his travels, and his writing, and loves to hear from people who have read his books.\u00a0\nTony will\u00a0be availble to sign books after the event.\u00a0\nPlease note:\n\nBookings are essential.\nPlease arrive 10 minutes early to allow time to check in; this assists the program to run on schedule.\nPlaces are limited to ensure the best possible experience.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep.

She uses a blend of mindfulness, coaching, NLP and Hawaiian bodywork to help others embrace life with greater self-awareness and joy.\nA long-time meditator, Joan knows firsthand how practising mindfulness is one of the most important things we can do to free ourselves from worry, judgement, self-criticism and struggle.
