When coffees are experienced comparatively, their different flavour profiles emerge. Over time you can identify a Kenyan coffee just by its taste, and you will know what we mean when we describe a coffee's mouthfeel, or identify its flavour as fruity or winey or milk chocolatey.\nAt a cupping, there are up to 5 coffees on the table. We always taste blind \u2013 i.e. we don't know until the end of the session which coffee is which, to avoid preconceptions of what a given coffee 'should' taste like. We start by assessing the dry aroma, then the wet aroma. Then the fun bit: the slurping and spitting! Our staff will guide you through the evaluation, explaining what we look for when we assess and score the coffees.\nPlease register your attendance to this event to secure your spot - we can only accommodate a maximum of 8 people.

For customers and newcomers, it is a great way to compare coffees side by side\u00a0and to begin to develop your palate. When coffees are experienced comparatively, their different flavour profiles emerge. Over time you can identify a Kenyan coffee just by its taste, and you will know what we mean when we describe a coffee's mouthfeel, or identify its flavour as fruity or winey or milk chocolatey.\nAt a cupping, there are up to 5 coffees on the table. We always taste blind \u2013 i.e. we don't know until the end of the session which coffee is which, to avoid preconceptions of what a given coffee 'should' taste like. We start by assessing the dry aroma, then the wet aroma. Then the fun bit: the slurping and spitting! Our staff will guide you through the evaluation, explaining what we look for when we assess and score the coffees.\nPlease register your attendance to this event to secure your spot - we can only accommodate a maximum of 8 people.
