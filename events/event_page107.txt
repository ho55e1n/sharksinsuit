Please note that booking fees and credit card payment processing fees apply to all ticket purchases.\nWhat will I need to bring with me to GABS?\nBe sure to bring your ticket (either printed or on your phone), your debit or credit card (to be able to buy food and drink), and your proof of age.\nGABS is a 100% cashless event. You\u2019ll be able to pay for all food, drink and merch quickly and easily using your credit, debit or EFTPOS card at all bars, exhibitor stands and food vendors. We\u2019ve partnered with Square to provide card readers for all points of sale at GABS and you will just need to tap your card to pay! Please make sure to bring your payWave or PayPass card, or any device with Apple Pay or Google Pay, along with your ticket and ID, and you\u2019re all set.\nI\u2019m a My Dan Murphy\u2019s customer. How do I redeem my discount?\nPlease check your inbox for an email from the My Dan Murphy\u2019s team with a unique code to redeem your My Dan Murphy\u2019s benefits.\nI have a promo code. How do I use it?\nOoh, lucky you! When you click the green \u2018Tickets\u2019 button, a box will appear with all the ticket types. Just click \u2018Enter Promotional Code\u2019 in the top right corner and your promo benefit will apply.\nWhen will I get my ticket(s)?\nAfter completing your purchase, your tickets will be emailed to you as a PDF. You\u2019ll need to print these out with you and bring them to the event. If you don\u2019t receive your tickets, please check your junk/spam folder. If not there, please login to your Eventbrite account and check your account to see if you entered the correct email address.\nCan you resend my ticket(s)?\nYou can reprint your own tickets from Eventbrite. Please login to your account, go to \u2018Tickets\u2019, select the tickets then reprint them. If you have any issues, please email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer\u00a0with the details.\nCan I transfer my ticket to another session?\nIf you have a Single Session ticket, you can change your session by logging onto your Eventbrite account and under \u2018Tickets\u2019 clicking the transfer icon. For more details on how to do this please visit the\u00a0transfer information page. Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.\nBeer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.\nI\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?\nUnfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.\nCan I give my ticket to someone else?\nIf you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.\nCan people under 18 attend?\nIn Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.\nWhat happens when I get there?\nOn arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in. Season Pass ticket holders will be given Season Pass accreditation, which must be shown when entering each session.\nPlease be prepared to show your valid ID. Please note all bags are subject to inspection at any point during the event. Bottles, cans, glass, food, drink, alcohol, illicit drugs, illegal substances, fireworks, explosives or anything that can be used as a weapon cannot be brought into the festival.\nAs you enter, you\u2019ll be given a Festival Glass and your Official GABS Guide. And then you\u2019re good to go!\nI have applied to be a volunteer. Do I need to purchase a ticket?\nGreat work. We love our volunteers! All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).\nWill tickets sell out?\nThe majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.\nWhat if I don\u2019t have proof of age?\nGABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.\nWhen do the bars close?\nAll bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.\nWhat sort of behaviour is unacceptable?\nIf anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.\nI have a question that\u2019s not answered here.\nPlease read through the GABS\u00a0website\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there. Alternatively, please feel free to message us on Facebook or email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer.\nPlease note that by purchasing a ticket to GABS 2019, you consent to any photos of you at the event to be used for future marketing purposes. If you prefer us not to use your photo, please get in touch us at\u00a0contact@gabs.beer\u00a0and we\u2019ll make sure this happens.\nAs a ticket buyer, you will automatically be opted in to receive the GABS News email newsletter.

Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.</P>\n<P>Beer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Unfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can I give my ticket to someone else?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can people under 18 attend?</STRONG></P>\n<P>In Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What happens when I get there?</STRONG></P>\n<P>On arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in.

All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).</P>\n<P><STRONG>Will tickets sell out?</STRONG></P>\n<P>The majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What if I don\u2019t have proof of age?</STRONG></P>\n<P>GABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.</P>\n<P><STRONG>When do the bars close?</STRONG></P>\n<P>All bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What sort of behaviour is unacceptable?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I have a question that\u2019s not answered here.</STRONG></P>\n<P>Please read through the GABS\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.gabsfestival.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">website</A>\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there.

The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \nOnly mum-to-be needs to join ABA and buy a ticket - each participant can bring along her partner or support person for free. Please make sure you have booked a 'Participant' ticket!\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nComplimentary handout material \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

Our head, right? Our indigenous ancestors would respond by touching their hearts. They understood the heart\u2019s innate wisdom and its ability to perceive and decipher the world around them.\u00a0\nThe afternoon begins with a deep dive into the energetic heart and offers the opportunity to tap into our innate intuition and realign our hearts and minds. From there, we will learn how the shaman's understood the essential qualities of the heart.\nShamanism is the oldest of spiritual and meditative practices, dating back tens of thousands of years. It puts us in contact with our higher self and allows us to build wisdom, intuition and healing energy. At its essence, shamanism uses meditation, rhythm and intention to connect with the non-ordinary dimension of reality.\u00a0In the second part of the workshop, we will make use of the heart techniques discovered earlier to journey to this awakened connection through direct revelation. We will discover how to integrate basic shamanic techniques and ancient wisdom into our daily lives.\n'Shaman's Heart' will conclude with a full moon ceremony hosted by Asher.\nThis workshop is suitable for everyone; no previous experience with meditation or shamanic practice is necessary. Snacks will be provided during the main break.\u00a0Spaces are limited.\nPlease do your best to remain caffeine and alcohol-free for at least three days prior to the workshop. Spend some time before you arrive setting a clear, concise intention for your participation and, on the day, feel free to bring along an object sacred to you to be energised and blessed in the circle.",
