We will explore two topics of relevance to contemporary Australian societies, with a particular focus on non-metropolitan communities.\r\nFirstly, Professor Kurt Lushington (Division of Education, Arts and Social Sciences) will provide insight into the digital world and its relationship with sleep in children.\r\nThereafter, Professor Marion Eckert (Division of Health Sciences) will note the surprising prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancers amongst Australians, with a study focussed on South Australians living in non-metropolitan areas.\r\nFollowing these presentations, a Q-and-A session will be provided, for which the audience\u2019s questions and comments will be most welcome.\r\nWe will conclude the evening with refreshments and an opportunity to mingle and network with senior University researchers and other attendees.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFAQs\r\n\u00a0\r\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\r\nNo.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\r\nThere is ample parking available in front of the University of South Australia Building.\r\nPlease note: the TAFE SA car park that is located adjacent to the UniSA\u00a0 car park is locked at night.\u00a0 Your car is at risk of being locked in if you park in the TAFE SA car park.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\r\nFor all enquiries contact Michele on 8721 8902.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?\r\nYes.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?\r\nYes.\r\n",

Discussion and questions are encouraged throughout the presentation.\nAward-winning children's author Chris Collin will share his personal journey fostering the magic of literacy through fun and funkiness. Through this fun presentation, Chris will acknowledge the incredibly important role parents and early educators play in the fostering of reading and literacy in young children. The presentation will detail the fun ways the author presents his books, using voice animation, puppetry, singing, dance/movement and drawing, using a combination of art and puppetry together.Chris will share his experience of stepping right out of his comfort zone, to make reading fun; encouraging children and adults alike, to 'read for the joy of reading!'An interactive activity will form part of the presentation \u2013 details to be provided on the night!\nChris will also share his \u2018light bulb\u2019 moment when he overcame his own fears in reading to young audiences; realising he won\u2019t be judged and in turn rediscovering his own inner-child. In Chris\u2019 experience, engagement is the key. Children may be non-judgemental, but they are also very honest. If what is being presented to them is not interesting and engaging, their interest can be lost in a very short space of time. Unlike we adults who will just try to grin, nod our heads and bear it, kids will bluntly let us know by wriggling, talking, facing backwards, nose-picking or worse!The more animated and joyful the adult is when reading, the more engaging the learning experience can become. It\u2019s very simple \u2013 ANIMATION = INTERESTING!\nThe presentation will culminate with more audience participation, where eight brave \u2018over-actors\u2019 will be invited to join Chris in stepping out of their own comfort zone, and \u2018act out\u2019 one of Chris\u2019 stories; becoming their own book character, with costumes and voice animation.

They are making their twenty-ninth, and perhaps final, attempt to find the country's famed Inland Sea.\nOn the road north from Melbourne, Simpson and his weary donkey encounter a broke single mother, a suicidal Vietnam veteran, a refugee who has lost everything, an abused teenager and a deranged ex-teacher. These are society's downtrodden, whom Simpson believes can be renewed by the healing waters of the sea.\nIn Simpson Returns, Wayne Macauley sticks a pin in the balloon of our national myth. A concise satire of Australian platitudes about fairness and egalitarianism, it is timely, devastating and witheringly funny.\n\nPRAISE:\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018He makes readers feel uncomfortable, unsettled in the everyday; one emerges from his books freshly uncertain.\u2019\n\nLifted Brow\n\n\n\n\u2018Macauley is a mean satirist with a gift for finding the queasy depths in apparently soft targets\u2026Together, these characters form a mosaic of desperation, inequality and sometimes gendered violence\u2026At the end of the novel\u2026we\u2019re asking questions specific to this story, about how compassion works and what it really is. It\u2019s an unusual renewal of an ordinary myth, not always simple to interpret.\u2019\n\nSaturday Paper\n\n\n\n\u2018Macauley\u2019s novels are consistently savage critiques of Australian middle class delusions, and\u00a0Simpson Returns\u00a0is no exception. He brings considerable depth to his portrayal of our social fragility and the destructive all-pervasive darkness underneath. Simpson reflects at one point: \u201cThere is always a certain amount of self-deceit necessary for the healthy maintenance of a society hell-bent on proving the sun shines out of its arse.\u201d A must read.\u2019\n\nBooknotes\n\n\nABOUT THE HOST:\n\n\n\n\n\nWayne Macauley is the author of the acclaimed novels Blueprints for a Barbed-Wire Canoe, Caravan Story, The Cook and Demons. The Cook was shortlisted for a Western Australian Premier''s Book Award, a Victorian Premier's Literary Award and the Melbourne Prize Best Writing Award.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Presenting Dr. Peter Wilton, University of California, Berkeley, an international expert in innovation, customer engagement, and digital transformation strategy.\nIn this Business Forum, our special guest Dr. Peter Wilton will talk to us about the process of \u201cSustaining Organisational Leadership through Disruptive Innovation\u201d, outlining key strategic innovation and value-creation principles that are applicable to any industry or sector. Critically, he will discuss the pathway to managing the organisational resilience challenge in order to drive enduring client loyalty and stakeholder advocacy. \nKey Messages:\n\nNo industry or sector is immune from disruption \n\n\nAll disruption occurs not because of technology, but because of overlooked or under-served customer/stakeholder needs\n\n\n\u201cCustomer satisfaction\u201d and \u201cNet Promoter\u201d metrics are not true measures of customer loyalty, nor do they provide the customer discovery insights necessary to reframe customer value and improve organisational performance\n\n\nThe strategy of NOT disrupting can lead to market irrelevance\n\n\nDisruption risk can be mitigated by building a balanced portfolio (offerings) of sustaining and reframing customer value innovations\n\n\nManaging the organisation\u2019s innovation portfolio requires commitment to two separate, but parallel innovation processes, cultures, and governance models.\n\nThe Return:\nThe result of systematically managing the innovation leadership challenge is to refocus the organisation\u2026.\n\nfrom being reactive to being pro-active\n\n\nfrom being a follower of market behavior and responder to regulatory reform to being a shaper of a clearly articulated envisioned future\n\n\nfrom merely satisfying current customer and stakeholder requirements to delivering value in ways that have been previously unrecognised.\n\nThe payoff is a \u201cunique class\u201d leadership position and sustained stakeholder and customer commitment. \nAbout the Speaker:\nDr. Peter Wilton teaches strategy, innovation, and customer engagement at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, and Digital Transformation Strategy in the Silicon Valley.\nHe has been the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships for his work in management, including from the National Science Foundation, Marketing Science Institute, Australian Overseas Fellowship in Management, and Market Research Society of Australia Prize. In the US, he has been recognised by Business Week magazine as one of the country\u2019s leading business instructors and recognised in the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d Registry of Leading American Executives. Dr. Wilton also provides strategic advisory and executive development services to a list of clients representing diverse industries and regions of the world. He divides his time between his home base in Sydney and San Francisco.\nOther:\nRegistration: 7:15am for 7:30 start. A hot breakfast will be served at this function.\nThe event is presented by Soula Skliros, Sinapse & Penny Sahinis, willbak.com.\nIndividual and group tickets can be purchased (8 per table).\nNumbers to this event are limited.\nwww.sinapse.com.au\nwww.willbak.com\n",
