We have a unique opportunity for students of creative writing (undergraduate or postgraduate) or anyone interested in literary creation to attend an exclusive writing workshop with the prized Chilean author Carla Guelfenbein. \r\n\r\nCarla Guelfenbein is a Chilean author of Russian-Jewish descent. Her works include\u00a0El rev\u00e9s del alma,\u00a0La mujer de mi vida,\u00a0The Rest is Silence, Nadar desnudas,\u00a0Ll\u00e9vame al cielo,\u00a0and\u00a0La estaci\u00f3n de las mujeres. Her works are enjoyed both in Chile and internationally, topping local bestseller lists for weeks for her novels some of which have been translated into 16 languages. In the last twenty years she has risen to prominence, having been described as \u201cOne of the most important authors of the first years of the 21st\u00a0century in Chile\u201d (El Mercurio), and attracting the praise of Nobel Prize winner J. M. Coetzee who described her writing as \u201cSubtle, clearsighted, and compassionate\u201d. In May 2019 Carla Guelfenbein will be an international guest at the Sydney and Auckland Writers Festivals, as well as the Humanities Research Centre on the occasion of the recent translation of her novel\u00a0In the Distance with you\u00a0(2018) by Other Press.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCarla has extensive experience with writing workshops\u2014which have quite a significant tradition in Chile\u2014, having attended during the 1990s the workshops of P\u00eda Barros and Gonzalo Contreras (two important end-of-century Chilean authors). She also currently conducts her own writing workshop in Chile which is attended by a diverse cohort from young and old, to artists and psychiatrists, all wanting to learn the narrative art. \r\n\u00a0\r\nIn preparation for the masterclass we will be reading two of Carla\u2019s short stories: \u2018Ana and the Water\u2019 and \u2018Towards the South\u2019 (translated by Nicole Bell). Once you have registered these readings will be provided to you (please do not share these publicly). It is recommended that all participants also attend the public interview and Q&A with Carla at the Humanities Research Centre on Monday the 6th of May 4:30-5:30, where they will have the chance to hear about her life, work, and recently translated novel In the Distance with You (2018).

Many people live a hectic, city-dwelling lifestyle - but we need opportunities for restorative practices, to be calm and take 'time out'. Observing the little creatures that fossick and fly around us can provide the all-important mindfulness we need. This workshop will include insect identification skills and how citizen science can help increase our understanding of insect-plant interactions in urban environments. We will integrate this with a photography workshop, which will provide you with the keen observation\u00a0skills and tools to create photographs of insects within The Living Pavilion.\nThis workshop will focus on photographing insects with a SmartPhone/iPhone, so please bring yours to the workshop. You are welcome to bring another camera of your choice as well. No prior photography experience is required.\u00a0\nPlease note that these research workshops are designed for adults 18+ years and over.

Each seminar focuses on an individual Goal, offering an opportunity to explore the intent of the Goal, its targets, and some of the initiatives being undertaken to deliver on them. Each seminar will be accompanied by a Policy Brief.\nSDG 4: Quality Education\nSustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education, aims to \u2018ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u2019 Through this seminar we aim to open a conversation about the two areas of work that Australia, by signing up to the SDGs, has committed to, namely, the achievement of the goals and targets of SDG 4 in Australia and Australia\u2019s contribution to advancing SDG4 through aid and development.\nPanellists\nEmily Maiorino,\u00a0Graduate, Master of International Development, RMIT University\nEmily is a recent graduate from RMIT who conducted her International Development Research Project in Kampong Cham province of Cambodia.

He is the lead CI on a current ARC Discovery project titled Arts based social enterprises and marginalised young people\u2019s transitions (blog here)\n\nDr Carolyn Johnstone,\u00a0Humanities and Social Science, Federation University\nCarolyn Johnstone is the Associate Dean, Teaching Quality in the School of Arts and Chair of the Learning and Teaching Committee at Federation University. She is the Convenor of the Australian Coalition for Education and Development (ACED), that prepared the Australian SDG 4 Spotlight Report that is being launched today.

By strengthening collaboration amongst researchers and policy makers, the Network promotes a more effective evidence-base for EU institutions to engage with nations in the region to implement the SDGs. Its core question is: how can European Union integration be more effective in supporting the implementation of the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific than would be possible for individual Member States? How can this role be developed further?\n\u00a0\nBanner Image:\u00a0\u00a9 European Union\u00a0, 2017\u00a0\u00a0 / \u00a0Source: EC - Audiovisual Service\u00a0\u00a0 / \u00a0 Photo:\u00a0Jennifer Jacquemart\n\nPresented by the EU Centre and Social and Global Studies Centre at RMIT University.
