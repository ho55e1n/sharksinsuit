And have fun doing it.\nOur Guest Speaker this month is\u00a0Thomas Philbin-Malucelli\u00a0who is an ambitious\u00a0leader who is half English, half Italian. He started travelling at the age of 22 and\u00a0hasn\u2019t returned home since.\nWhilst enjoying the freedom of travelling the world Thomas was not stepping into\u00a0his full potential. Four years ago he was dragged by his girlfriend, Brittany to an ISAGENIX CELEBRATION who had inspiration to create a new business and healthy\u00a0lifestyle.\nThen 2 years ago, Brittany got fed up of Thomas\u2019s mediocre lifestyle that she gave\u00a0him an ultimatum. She said, \u2018Thomas, if you don\u2019t become the man I know you\u00a0can become, I\u2019m going to find someone else to build in my life with!\u2019\nThe next day Thomas signed up his first ISA Body Challenge and submitted his raw\u00a0BEFORE picture in the group. Thomas was in shock with the amount of love and\u00a0support he received from everyone. It just ignited so much fire in his belly that\u00a0led him to WIN the AUSTRALIA NATIONAL ISABODY CHAMPION this year in March\u00a02019.\nIn his WINNING speech, Thomas said, \u2018I am just so proud to be representing what\u2019s\u00a0possible when you make a decision to completely go for what you know you are\u00a0worth!. And, if I can do this, you can too.\u2019\nThomas is passionate about his work as a health and wellness coach (and has\u00a0recently become certified as an NLP practitioner). As well as helping others achieve\u00a0their goals, he is now preparing to compete to WIN the WORLD ISA BODY CHAMPION\u00a0title this August 2019.\nAt our Ambitious Leaders Network Event Katie-Jeyn\u00a0will provide a Career Acceleration Power Tip to help you to fast track your career and business success. And\u00a0\u00a0Thomas is going to share with us\u00a0\"How to LIVE in the BODY of YOUR DREAMS and have the ENERGY to BOOM your health\u00a0and business at the same time.\"\nThomas' speech will be followed by\u00a0networking where we will connect with awesome like-minded leaders.\nDetails\nDates: \u00a0Thursday, 16 May 2019Venue: The Savoy Hotel On Little Collins MelbourneAddress: Cnr Spencer and Little Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000Time: 6.00 PM to 8.30 PMInvestment: $30Drinks: Ticket includes a drink from the bar will on arrival.\u00a0 Additional drinks may be purchased at the bar.\u00a0\u00a0Tea, coffee, water will\u00a0 also be provided.Supper: \u00a0A light supper will be provided.\nCan't wait to meet you!! \u00a0And, bring a friend.!\n",

He started travelling at the age of 22 and\u00a0hasn\u2019t returned home since.</P>\n<P><EM>Whilst enjoying the freedom of travelling the world Thomas was not stepping into\u00a0his full potential. Four years ago he was dragged by his girlfriend, Brittany to an <STRONG>ISAGENIX CELEBRATION</STRONG> who had inspiration to create a new business and healthy\u00a0lifestyle.</EM></P>\n<P><EM>Then 2 years ago, Brittany got fed up of Thomas\u2019s mediocre lifestyle that she gave\u00a0him an ultimatum. She said, \u2018Thomas, if you don\u2019t become the man I know you\u00a0can become, I\u2019m going to find someone else to build in my life with!\u2019</EM></P>\n<P><EM>The next day Thomas signed up his first ISA Body Challenge and submitted his raw\u00a0BEFORE picture in the group. Thomas was in shock with the amount of love and\u00a0support he received from everyone. It just ignited so much fire in his belly that\u00a0led him to <STRONG>WIN</STRONG> the <STRONG>AUSTRALIA NATIONAL ISABODY CHAMPION</STRONG> this year in March\u00a0</EM><EM>2019.</EM></P>\n<P><EM>In his <STRONG>WINNING</STRONG> speech, Thomas said, <STRONG>\u2018</STRONG>I am just so proud to be representing what\u2019s\u00a0possible when you make a decision to completely go for what you know you are\u00a0worth!.<STRONG> And, if I can do this, you can too.\u2019</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><EM>Thomas is passionate about his work as a health and wellness coach (and has\u00a0recently become certified as an NLP practitioner). As well as helping others achieve\u00a0their goals, he is now preparing to compete to <STRONG>WIN</STRONG> the <STRONG>WORLD ISA BODY CHAMPION</STRONG>\u00a0title this August 2019.</EM></P>\n<P>At our Ambitious Leaders Network Event <A HREF=\"https://web.facebook.com/katiejeynromeyn/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" TITLE=\"Katie-Jeyn Romeyn\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Katie-Jeyn</A>\u00a0will provide a Career Acceleration Power Tip to help you to fast track your career and business success.
