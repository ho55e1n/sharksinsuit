Dr Jane Goodall uncovered the complexity of social and familial life within groups of wild chimpanzees, highlighting the connection between humans and our closest living relatives. Through her groundbreaking work in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe Stream National Park, Dr Goodall redefined how scientists interact with the wild, contributing to one of the greatest studies of primates the world has ever seen. She has lamented that Tarzan married the wrong Jane...and we agree.\n\nWith the 60th anniversary of her arrival in Gombe approaching in 2020, Dr Goodall once again joins Think Inc. to celebrate her work and reflect on how the study that she began years ago endures today.\u00a0This event will consist of a 40-minute lecture by Dr Jane Goodall, followed by a 40-minute conversation between Dr Jane Goodall and the event host. Think Inc. & the Jane Goodall Institute Australia are honoured to present Jane Goodall: Rewind the Future, the 2019 Australian Tour.\n\nDoors open: 6:00PM\nEvent start: 7:00PM\nEvent ends: 8:30PM\nMeet and greet ends: 9:30PM\n\nBefore purchasing, please review your ticket choice as all student tickets require a student ID.

We look forward to welcoming you and your family at Rivers.\nGeneral Information As Mother\u2019s Day is one of our busiest days of the year, we have sitting times in order to be as organised as we can to ensure a smooth operation for you and your family. Please note if you are running late then this will reduce the time you have on your table. \nIf booking on the Caf\u00e9 deck, please note that this area is a semi outdoor area, so whilst it is protected from the weather, it is not a fully heated space. Therefore if you book this area and the day is cold, you will not be able to move inside, just add another layer to keep warm! Please note that as normal, our open air dining zones are non-bookable spaces.These spaces will be open over the Mother\u2019s Day weekend and are available on a first come basis.\n\u00a0Booking & Deposit\u00a0You booking requires a $10 deposit per person in order to secure a table. (This is deducted from your account on the day). If you have children who do not require a chair within your booking (ie you require a highchair or space for a pram) please call us on 9436 3210 (Monday \u2013 Friday only) so that we can assist in getting the right table to suit your needs.\nMenus & Prices Please click on the link below to view a sample menu. Breakfast Sample Menu (including kids) Children & Menu\u2019s As Rivers is family friendly, children and babies are most welcome. We offer a children\u2019s menu for 2-12 years of age. If your child is too young to sit in a seat, then you may use a high chair or bring one with you. High chairs are available on a first come basis. As space is limited, we would appreciate if you can leave prams at the entrance, however if this is needed for your sleeping baby, then you are welcome to bring it in.\nSpecial Dietary Needs For special dietary needs our Mother\u2019s Day Menu cater for vegetarians, gluten free and vegan diets. Our dishes are marked accordingly so that you can see what is on offer before you book and they are clear to see on the day. If you are booking for high tea please make sure that you indicate any of these needs when making your booking. \nRefunds & Cancellations Full refunds on your deposit are available if written notice via email is given at least 7 days prior to the event.
