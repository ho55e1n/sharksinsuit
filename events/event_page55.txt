One of the best ways to identify frogs is to know the male advertisement calls. Frogs love to sing, creating many sounds from bops, bops, bonks, growls and tocks - these sounds can fill wetlands, creeks and dams across the landscape. But sadly, many of these sounds have disappeared, particularly in cities. Join us at The Living pavilion\u00a0to re-imagine a city full of frogs. This workshop\u00a0will involve immersing yourself in a 'frog soundscape' created for The Living Pavilion and exploring when, where and why frogs call, and what human-related activities disrupt this important behavior. We will combine this with a fun musical activity to recreate frog calls our 'frog ensemble' and empathize with the plight of frogs in urban environments.\u00a0\nPlease note that these research workshops are designed for adults 18+ years and over. Children are welcome to attend and participate, however, they will not form part of the research observations or survey data collection. \nHosted by: Christina Renowden\n\nThis event is hosted by THRIVE and CAUL.\n\nHow to get there:\u00a0\nTrams 1, 3, 5, 6, 16, 64, 67, 72 Swanston Street to The University of Melbourne.\nThe Living Pavilion is an outdoors event and we encourage you to dress for the weather. If weather gets the better of us we will advise whether the venue will change or the event is cancelled. Apologies in\u00a0advance.\nThis event is part of The Living Pavilion (1-17 May) -\u00a0a transdisciplinary project connecting Indigenous knowledge, ecological science, sustainable design and participatory arts.",
