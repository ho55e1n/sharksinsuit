                "text": "Design Research provides the tools designers need to study the ways we live, work and play.\nDesigning for service and product innovation requires that designers spend time with people, understanding not just what they do, but how and why. Observing, documenting and analysing human behaviour helps us identify the similarities and differences between people, and the outliers and workarounds that highlight service gaps or failures. \nThis two-day workshop will introduce you to the tools and methods of ethnography \u2013 the foundation of design research. It will give you a mix of theory and practical experience that you can directly apply to your design and research projects.\nJoin us for two full days \u2013 $900 incl GST.\n\n\n\nDay One - Ethnography and Design\u00a0\nDay One provides an introduction to ethnography, its connection to design, and its potential for addressing complex organisational and social issues involved in service delivery. The focus will be on human-centred research and design challenges, including the education of decision makers and influencers to comprehend and translate learnings into service and product improvement and innovation.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe day focuses on giving practitioners an understanding of key methodologies and approaches to ethnographic research, including how to appropriately engage and \u2018be there with people\u2019 to understand their worlds. It will provide attendees with the tools and understanding required to apply ethnography to their design projects. This day also offers a chance for reflective practice where we will ask attendees to draw on their own design project experiences.\nKey topics covered include:\n\n\nAn introduction to ethnography and why it is valuable\n\n\nHow ethnography is different to other types of research (such as market research)\n\n\nThe connections between ethnography and design\n\n\nThe challenges and opportunities of research and design in government and organisational contexts, including reflection on our collective project experiences\n\n\nDay One closes with applied research practice around the question: What's it like to be a designer and researcher in an organisation? The data generated from this will be used in Day Two.\n\nDay Two - Making Sense Together\nDay Two provides an introduction to collaborative sense-making, communication techniques, and ethnographic methods that help designers use research data in effective ways. We will work with data generated on Day One in order to identify problems and opportunities for design and research work in organisations.\nKey topics covered include:\n\n\n\"Collective hunch-making\" - methods for making sense of research data with others\n\n\nIntroduction to qualitative data coding\n\n\nUsing journey maps and sketches to communicate a problem\n\n\nIdentifying opportunities and building a case for change, using research data\n\n\nHow to use stories to inspire service, product and policy responses\n\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nBy the end of the two days you will have learned:\n\n\nThe basics of design research, it's links to ethnography, and how it is used\n\n\nCore ethnographic methods and their connection to design\n\n\nHow to apply ethnographic methods on a design project, with guided activities and reusable templates\n\n\nHow and why to use ethnographic methods to research people and their lives, (including minority groups, such as indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse communities)\n\n\nHow and why to use ethnography to research organisational and front line staff\n\n\nHow to use ethnographic research data to inform design outcomes\n\n\nHow to use ethnographic data to tell stories within your organisation and make a case for change\n\n\n\nWho should take this course?\nThis course is for design professionals who are interested in building a deeper understanding of research and its connection to service and product innovation.\u00a0\n\nWhy us?\nPaper Giant is a strategic design agency that helps organisations understand and solve complex problems. We have worked extensively across the public and private sector, and have developed expertise in government at all levels, in health, education, social justice, community development and finance. We have worked with the Australian, State and Local Governments, Medibank, Bupa, Telstra, ANZ, the Digital Transformation Agency and Victorian Legal Aid.\nDr Chris Marmo is research director at Paper Giant and is one of Australia\u2019s most experienced researchers and designers.\nAshlee Riordan\u00a0is Organisational Design and Capability Lead at Paper Giant. Ashlee is an experienced educator and researcher. With a background in psychology, anthropology and education, she brings deep methodological experience and nearly a decade of professional experience in human centred design. Alongside her role at Paper Giant, Ashlee teaches at Melbourne University and as required for Victoria University, Latrobe, Swinburne and RMIT.\nCatherine Sutton-Long is Design Research Lead at Paper Giant.\u00a0Cat is an experienced design and research leader and educator. In the past 15 years, she has worked with a number of organisations in multiple countries, to deliver design and research projects. She is highly experienced in research and training design, workshop design and facilitation.\nIn 2018, Paper Giant was the receipient of a Good Design award for Social Impact, working with a team from RMIT University applying design research and co-design methods to work with the Wiradjuri people.\u00a0\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this workshop, please get in touch with ashlee.riordan@papergiant.net",

                "text": "Course Description:\u00a0Power BI is the newest Microsoft Business Intelligence and Data Analysis tool.\u00a0In this module we will go through basics of this product, and introduce all five components of Power BI (Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, Power Map, and Power Q&A).\nYou will see some demos and introduction about Power BI desktop, Office 365 Power BI subscription, and Power BI website, and mobile apps. You will see some basic demos of how easy to use is Power BI in some scenarios.\nModule 1: Introduction to Power BI\nPower BI is the newest Microsoft Business Intelligence and Data Analysis tool. In this module we will go through basics of this product, and introduce all five components of Power BI (Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, Power Map, and Power Q&A). You will see some demos and introduction about Power BI desktop, Office 365 Power BI subscription, and Power BI website, and mobile apps. You will see some basic demos of how easy to use is Power BI in some scenarios.\nModule 2: Getting Data\nGetting Data is the first experience of working with Power BI. You can connect to many data sources on-premises or on cloud. For some data sources you can have a live or direct connection, for some connection works offline. For some connections you need a gateway or connector to be installed. In this module you will learn everything about get data experience of Power BI.\nModule 3: Power Query for Data Transformation\nData analysis and BI world starts from data extraction and transformation. Power Query is the data transformation engine of Power BI. Power Query comes as part of Excel 2016, or as an add-in for Excel 2013 and 2010. Power Query is also part of Power BI Desktop. In this module you will learn about all different version of Power Query, their similarities, and differences, as well as configuration and requirements of using them.Power Query uses a graphical user interface to apply transformations on the dataset. However Power Query works with a functional scripting language behind the scenes. The key to learn Power Query is learning the functional language called M. There are many features in M that are not available in the Power Query GUI. In this module you will learn how to understand M, and how to write M scripts even from scratch. You will learn writing custom functions in M as well as many other useful features.\nModule 4: Power Pivot for Data Modelling\nPower Pivot is xVelocity in-memory data modelling engine of the Power BI. Modelling effectively is the key of high performance BI solution. In this module you will learn basics of Power Pivot such as creating relationships, and calculated members, as well as advanced best practices and DAX expressions. DAX is Data Analytical eXpression language. DAX has similar structure to excel functions, but it is different. In this module you will learn DAX from beginner to advance. You will learn basic functions as well as complex functions and scenarios of using them in real world challenges.\nModule 5: Data Visualidation with Power BI Desktop, Power View and Power Map\nData Visualization is the front end of any BI application, this is the user view point of your system. It is critical to visualize measures, and dimensions effectively so the BI system could tell the story of the data clearly. In this module you will learn conceptual best practices of data visualizations which is valid through all data visualization tools. You will learn Power View and Power Map skills. Power View is the interactive data visualization tool and Power Map is 3D geo-spatial data visualization tool. You will learn how to create effective charts, and dashboards using these tools as well as best practices for working with these tools. There are two version of Power View; Power View for Excel, and Power View for SharePoint which will be covered in this module as well.\nModule 6: Designing the best solution with Power Q&A\nPower BI introduced a new engine for users which focus on users who wants to play with the data more, and understand the story behind the data better. Power Q&A is question and answering engine which works based on human natural language. Power Q&A automatically will be enabled on Power BI files deployed into Power BI website, or Office 365 subscription. However there are some tips and tricks about how to design your model to get the best type of answers through Power Q&A. In this module you will learn best practices for modelling that effect on the response of Power Q&A.\nModule 7: Power BI Desktop; combination of three tools\nPower BI Desktop (Previously was known as Power BI Designer) is the new designer tool that enhance combination of three main Power BI components; Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View. Power BI Desktop has great features that will be fully explored in this module. There is slightly difference from components of Power BI desktop with their original versions; in this module you will learn these differences. You will learn how to use Power BI desktop to mash up data, model it, and visualize it. Best practices of design will be all discussed with demos.\nModule 8: Administration\nPower BI components can be deployed into different environments such as Power BI website, Office 365 subscription, or even SharePoint on-premises. In this module we will go through deployment options, Configurations and requirements required for each environment. You will learn how to deploy your Power BI files into Power BI website. you will also learn how to build dashboards in the website, and how to work with Mobile Apps for Apple, Android and Windows Phone.\n\n\u00a0Understand primary features of a self-service Power BI solution\nUtilize Power BI and its data sources\nCombine, analyze, model, shape, and visualize data\nReport data using rich dashboards\n\nOnce after the training you receive course completion certificate from Mangates",

A brief overview of the random forest algorithm.2. Out-of-sample estimates on training data, and applications in fraud, risk and outlier detection\u2014random forests can make confident predictions on training data, unlike most other methods.3. Single-model quantile regression\u2014estimating a full distribution, not just the mean. Vital for risk-based estimation.4. The proximity matrix\u2014a powerful visualisation, clustering and insights tool unique to random forests.5. Random forests as an unsupervised learning method---outlier detection and clustering when there are no target values\u2014vital for fraud detection.6. ranger, a fast, flexible implementation of random forests in R.7. extraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees), an extension to random forests that often adds more accuracy.8. Dealing with small data sets and small classes.A range of other topics, including recent works and extensions of existing packages, may also be covered.Trainees are expected to be familiar with R, the basics of machine learning and out-of-sample error estimation, and the basic workings of the random forest algorithm.\n\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\u00a0\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people.

His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services \n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course.
