The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized\u00a0Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification\u00a0exam.\nUnlike the\u00a0Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course\u00a0which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM II is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.\nWho Should Attend\nThe Professional Scrum Master II course is an advanced course specifically designed for experienced Scrum Masters who have a thorough understanding of the Scrum framework. \u00a0It is particularly beneficial for those people with at least one year of Scrum Master experience.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nOver the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Scrum Master such as how the principles and values of Scrum help guide Scrum Masters in the decisions they make and how the Scrum Master can help change the environment of Scrum Teams, creating an environment for agility to thrive.\u00a0The Scrum Master role is complex and often, a Scrum Master must be able to apply different stances in order to be effective, such as:\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Teacher\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Facilitator\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Change Agent\n\n\nAs a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.\nAs a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent. \u00a0Throughout the class, your PST will provide\u00a0stories,\u00a0exercises, facilitation techniques (such as \u201cLiberating Structures\u201d), resources and more.\nThere will also be time in class for the Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) to provide coaching on challenges that you and\u00a0your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy Scrum.org\nScrum.org provides the highest quality Scrum training, training materials and certified Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to teach them. Our training materials are created and maintained by Scrum co-creator Ken Schwaber, Scrum.org and the community of PSTs who teach the courses, helping to ensure that they are in tune with what\u2019s happening in software development organizations and always up-to-date with the latest practices.\nProfessional Scrum Trainers bring their own style and experience to the courses, but use the same materials so that students are learning from the same content regardless of who teaches the course or where it is taught around the world. \u00a0Read more\u00a0about the differences.\nYour Trainer - Rich Visotcky\n\"It is my mission to help people leverage different perspectives and new approaches to connect with what is truly important in their situation and solve the challenges they are facing.

Many people who experience mental distress have experienced trauma in their lives. \nThe objective of trauma-informed care is that all aspects of service delivery are informed by an understanding of the impact of trauma, which can result from family dysfunction, school or workplace bullying, violence and conflict, neglect or abuse. \nServices that do not understand and respond effectively to the impacts of trauma risk compounding the effects and creating further harm. \n\u00a0\nIn this course you will learn to:\n\u00a0\n\nUnderstand the current thinking about trauma informed care and how to apply this in the workplace.\nUnderstand how to respond and support people who have experienced trauma. \nUnderstand the difference between trauma-informed services and trauma therapy.\nIdentify stress responses. \nExplore the impact of intergenerational trauma - particularly in Aboriginal communities.\nExplore re-traumatisation in services and systems. \nExplore strategies for preventing and managing vicarious trauma.\nPromote safety: triggers and flashbacks, safe relationships, safe environments. \n\n\u00a0\nThe trainer \u2013 Emma Paino\nEmma is a lived experience mental health educator with a passion for community engagement and bridging the tensions between systems to create a better designed, inclusive and responsive mental health system.

For instructions,\u00a0click here.\n\n\n\nPredictive Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Science and Al\nOur leading course has transformed the machine-learning and data-science practice of the many managers, sponsors, key stakeholders, entrepreneurs and beginning data-science practitioners who have attended it.\nThis course is an intuitive, hands-on introduction to data science and machine learning. The training focuses on central concepts and key skills, leaving the trainee with a deep understanding of the foundations of data science and even some of the more advanced tools used in the field.\nThe course also covers key issues of data science practice in a work environment, and directs trainees to a range of further learning directions.\nThe skills taught are transferable to all software platforms, and\u00a0the course does not involve coding, or require any coding knowledge or experience. A tool with a graphical user interface is used so trainees can focus on learning the central skills and ideas.\nKey skills taught include building, assessing, selecting and deploying predictive models, as well as employing some of the most commonly used methods in the field, including general linear models (GLMs), and advanced methods such as random forests.\nThis course is also advertised as \"Introduction to Data Science\" and \"Introduction to Machine Learning\".\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people. Select your desired quantity of tickets and click \u201cAdd to cart\u201d to see the discount calculated before checkout.\nPlease contact us at enquiries@presciient.com to find out more about these special rates.\n\nCourse outline\nThis course will provide a conceptual overview and practical hands-on experience of a wide range of key tools, techniques and processes.\nAt the heart of the data mining toolkit is the suite of predictive modelling methods. Accordingly, the course will develop attendees' literacy in the strengths, characteristics and correct application of a range of predictive modelling methods, from relatively simple linear models through to complex and powerful Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Tree Boosting Machines and Neural Networks will be covered along the way.\nIt will also teach the correct framing of predictive modelling problems, suitably preparing data, evaluating model accuracy and stability, interpreting results and interrogating models.\nThe two key styles of predictive modelling \u2013 operational for targeting and explanatory for insights \u2013 will be described and distinguished.\nAs well as predictive modelling, the course will cover a range of other key data mining tools, including:\n\nData exploration and visualisation: univariate summaries, correlation matrices, heat maps, hierarchical clustering.\nCluster analysis \u2013 used for customer segmentation and anomaly detection\nOther \"unsupervised\" outlier detection tools.\n\nThis course will primarily be taught using Rattle, a graphical interface for predictive modelling and data science in R. Participants will be exposed to \"Big Data\" techniques as applied to machine learning and deployed on Cloud Computing platforms.\n\nAdditional topics\nThe following additional topics may be covered depending on the pace and interests of the class:\n\nLink and network analysis visualisation \u2013 which provide a simple and compelling way to communicate and analyse relationships, and are commonly applied in forensics, human resources and law enforcement.\nAssociation analysis \u2013 used in retail market basket analysis and the assessment of risk groupings.\nFrequent item set analysis.\n\n\nWho should attend?\nThis course is suitable for anyone in management, administrative, product, marketing, finance, risk and IT roles who works with data and wants to become acquainted with modern data analysis tools.\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prior knowledge of R is required to take this course.\n\nCourse outcomes\nAttendees should, by the end of the course:\n\nLearn fundamentals of predictive modelling and experience using a range of methods.\u00a0\nHave improved their ability to assess the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of any predictive modelling tool or technique.\u00a0\nHave experience with a range of unsupervised data techniques.\nBe exposed to Big Data and Cloud Computing applications.\n\n\nCourse instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services\u00a0\n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course.

Additional material may be presented, along with or in place of advertised.\n\nCancellations and refunds\nYou can get a full refund if you cancel 2 weeks or more before the course starts. No refunds will be issued for cancellations made less than 2 weeks before the course starts.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\nDo I need to bring my own computer?\nThere\u2019s no need to bring your own laptop or PC.\u00a0Our courses take place in modern, professional training facilities that have all the computing equipment you\u2019ll need.\nI'm lost!

They work by breaking down the top layer of dead skin cells, therefore smoothing away fine lines, hyperpigmentation and improving the overall appearance and condition of the skin. \u00a0CPD\u2019s workshop discusses the varying levels of product intensity and includes practical application.\nSkin needling is a minimally invasive skin penetrative procedure which uses a device containing fine needles for the purpose of puncturing the skin to create a controlled skin injury. This triggers the body to rebuild these micro wounds by producing new collagen and elastin in the dermis.\u00a0CPD\u2019s Skin Needling workshop provides both a theoretical understanding and practical experience in needling and the use of roller kits and skin needling pens.\nGraduates will receive a certificate on completion and will be able to immediately apply skills and techniques learnt.\n\nContact CPD Institute of Australia for further information on (03) 9041 3782 or visit www.cpdinstitute.com.au",
