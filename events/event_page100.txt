To build this future, we will need to make adjustments to how we live, work and play.\u00a0This means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels (such as petroleum, natural gas and coal) and increasing our uptake of alternative modes of transport (such as electric vehicles) and alternative forms of energy.\u00a0\nBy 2020 transport is expected to account for over 60% of Canberra\u2019s emissions.

To do so, students must submit a paper in groups of four to Actsmart Schools at actsmart@act.gov.au by 3rd May 2019.
