                "text": "The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations (AFDO) Disability Loop project is very fortunate to have received support from the Victorian Government to run a workshop about the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) around Victoria directly for people with disability and their families.\nThis workshop was written by a team of people with disability, some who are also NDIS participants. We believe that this allows the workshop to better meet the needs of people with a lived experience of disability. This workshop has been designed to make the NDIS easier to understand. In a small, interactive session, we will cover lots of different parts of the NDIS; from knowing who is eligible to get into the NDIS, working out what support you can get from the NDIS in your NDIS Plan, to actually using the funds in your NDIS Plan to live a better life in the community.\nIf you are a parent and/or a carer of a person with disability, we encourage you to consider bringing the person with disability along to the workshop. The NDIS is about people with disability so why not bring along the person who will benefit the most? There will be opportunities for breaks and a separate space available for resting and recovering if required.\nImportantly, these workshops are only for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend.\nUnderstanding the NDIS Workshop\nThe workshop is called Understanding the NDIS. It is a 3 hour workshop, with a short break in the middle. There are 3 workshops across three days at different times; however each workshop covers the same topics.\nIncluded in the workshop is a detailed participant handbook you can take home with you, as well as 5 factsheets with even more information about the NDIS.\nDo I need to pay to attend the workshops?\nThese workshops are free for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend. If you are unsure, please contact AFDO Disability Loop first.\nIf your organisation would like to assist multiple people with disability and/or families to register, please contact AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email disabilityloop@afdo.org.au before registering.\u2028\nWill AFDO Disability Loop provide accessibility supports?\nFor AFDO Disability Loop, accessibility is a priority. All workshops are held in accessible environments with accessible bathrooms in the same venue.\nWhen registering for the workshops, there is an option to tell us your accessibility needs. For example, AFDO can provide live captioning, Auslan interpreting, material in electronic formats, and other accessibility supports when they are required.\nIf you have any specific requests not listed on the registration form, please contact us and we can assist you where possible.\nWill food be provided at the event?\nYes. For those attending a session during the middle of the day, lunch or afternoon tea will be provided. For those attending the evening session, light snacks and/or sweets will be provided.\nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nYou can call AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email\u00a0disabilityloop@afdo.org.au\u00a0\n",

Join us for the\u00a0warmest\u00a0\u00a0introduction to\u00a0meditation this Winter!\nWhat to expect:\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Light stretching to still the body\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sound Mediation to still the mind\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Play! Fluffy cuddles from a furry friend\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait, but why are we meditating with this much cuteness? \u00a0Won\u2019t I be even MORE distracted?\nThe short answer is yes. The long answer is that Breathe In & Bleat Out is a metaphor for what meditating actually feels like when you first start. Your first meditation sitting isn\u2019t going to be perfect, and it certainly won\u2019t be still. You\u2019ll have thoughts, feelings, memories and dreams niggling at you, gnawing on you and clamouring for attention.\nJust like our furry friends. \n\nThese cuties nibble, nuzzle, dribble and piddle, but I can promise you won\u2019t get worked up over it. In fact, I can guarantee you\u2019ll leave with nothing but a smile! And maybe a few selfies (Good luck trying to get a baby goat to pose!) Instead of criticising yourself for being unable to sit still in perfect, spiritual silence, you\u2019ll learn to compassionately observe this chaos, embrace the moment and stop kicking yourself for not being so damn perfect all the time.\nWhy we chose baby goats:\n1) Fewer allergies than cats & dogs\n2) Cuddling causes warm fuzzy feelings in humans and animals! Whether from our human friends or furry ones, cuddling is proven to release oxytocin, which boosts the immune system, reduces stress and relieves pain! \u201cOxytocin is a natural stress reliever\u2026 it acts on our brain to diminish anxiety and induce relaxation\u201d - Harvard Health Letter.\n3) Researchers in the UK have found evidence that goats are just as clever as dogs, and build complex emotional relationships with humans!\n4) Stanford PAWS program has been using animal therapy for 20 years to raise the spirits of hospitalised patients. Animal therapy has also been found to reduce cortisol in Autistic children by up to 48%, as well as relieve symptoms of PTSD and schizophrenia.\n\n\n\nWhat is provided:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yoga Mat 6mm\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cushion\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hand towel\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organic Cleaner\n\nWhat you need (Optional):\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eye mask\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blanket/cover-up\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yoga Props\nYour friendly warning: Baby goats don't have complete control of their bladders & can get super excited without warning! The Karmably Cleaning Crew is always standing by for mishaps, but please come prepared for the worst. AKA go digging for your daggiest gym shirt and throw it over those nice, new tights when the mischief begins!\nOur baby goats come from a variety of centres. ABC Animal Farm began their mobile farm service as a means to rescue, feed and rehome neglected, surrendered and abandoned animals. Some of the furbabies in your class are rescues, and others are bred on the farm.

                "text": "ABOUT THIS EVENT: A PICASSO PARTY\nAlways a crowd pleaser, Picasso's paintings have appeared in many Classe Petit events - this time we're bringing them together for a cubist-inspired party! Featuring\u00a0Girl Before A Mirror,\u00a0Weeping Woman,\u00a0La Lecture\u00a0and\u00a0Le R\u00eave. Choose between either of these paintings, or perhaps be inspired by all of them - and make it your own!\n--\nClasse Petit's Social Painting sessions are a fun way to meet new people, rediscover your love for painting or simply explore what creativity means to you in a relaxing, supportive environment.

For information on other events drop over to facebook.com/ShadowsOfTantra\nThis workshop (ST02) is not for complete beginners. That doesn't mean it's 'full-on' or super-kinky. If anything it is even more centered and grounded.,\u00a0It simply moves more into the style of practitioner training. It is preferred therefore that you have either attended ST01 OR Tantra Of RB, OR have at least some basic prior experience in conscious intimacy (such as Shamanic Tantra or Conscious Kink) to attend this event. If unsure please contact us (ShadowsOfTantra@gmail.com)\nYou can attend this event with a specific partner and do all or most of the exercises with them, or you can attend as a single person. For exercises all pairings with other participants will be completely random. Nothing is compulsory at this workshop and an emphasis is placed on conscious authentic communication and personal boundaries.  We start off by recapping the core foundations of consent, intentionality, subtle energies and authentic expression before going more immersively into exercises that explore the actual embodied skills and various advanced aspects and perspectives of Shadow Tantra.  \n-----------------------------------------------\n Domination/Submission & Kink can be explored entirely as a 'Tantric' practice; as an experience of intentional (conscious) intimacy. This event teaches the critical foundations and experiences. Shadows Of Tantra have been running coaching and events in Melbourne since 2009.  'Shadow Tantra' is an approach to engaging in darker erotic interactions where the focus is on heart and connection. From which the archetypal polarity play can be as wicked, kinky or as tender (or whatever blend suits you) as you want.  Contrary to uninformed opinions, such perspectives for many people are exactly what they require in order to let go into very dark and incredibly satisfying parts of themselves. Shadow Tantra is it's own alchemical entity and is NOT 'lite-on' BDSM!!  Shadow Tantra places 'connection/authenticity/intimacy' first and 'thrills/activities' next. (The opposite approach to other well-known forms of erotic shadow play.) NOT at the expense of pleasure and excitement, but bringing even more depth and satisfaction. (And greatly reducing opportunities for disconnected insensitive experiences.)  Yes, play can be soft and flowing and incredibly satisfying. Yet can also be intensely dark if that's what is the authentic potential between you. Depending on the truth of the moment, what participants want, and the unique connection.\nThis is not a play-party or a casual kink event, but a genuine educational environment. Yes there will be practical exercises, but there will all be fully-clothed. NO direct sexual contact takes place at this event.\nNO Refunds are available once you have bought your ticket. In exceptional circumstances of hardship you may be able to transfer your ticket to a future event. You may possibly transfer your ticket to someone else. In either circumstance contact ShadowsOfTantra@gmail.com\nFor full details on this and related events please visit: www.facebook.com/ShadowsOfTantra",
