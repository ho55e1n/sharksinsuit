Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby.

Although breastfeeding is natural and best for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and\u00a0do,\u00a0breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.</P>\r\n<P>Our courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Our classes are exclusive to new or existing Australian Breastfeeding Association members.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: medium;\"><STRONG>In celebration of 50 years of the Australian Breastfeeding Association in Canberra in October 2019 we are offering our class and membership package for just $50\u00a0<SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small;\">+ booking fee</SPAN>\u00a0(save $40).

You'll get a pre-written character that you can expand on in online adventures in the weeks leading up to the game, through the pre-game workshops and through defining relationships with other characters. You can also request specific scenes or non-player character appearances to enhance your experience.\r\nThe beautiful venue and in-character catering will help you immerse yourself deeply into the world of Pax Europa, as will the high quality costumes, props and scene dressings.\r\nThe game will be held at the Auburn Hotel in Melbourne on 27 July 2019. It will include a fully catered afternoon tea, tea and coffee, and an in-character three course dinner. Alcoholic drinks will be available for purchase over the bar.\r\nThis will be the second time we've run the game and will include an expanded character list and some improvements from the first run.\r\nOutrageous costuming is strongly encouraged.\r\nIf you've never played a larp before, this is a great event to try it out for the first time.\r\nBuy a ticket before 1 April to get into the first round of character choices.\r\nMore details about the game are available at steamlarp.com\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe recognise that the ticket price is relatively high compared to most larps in Australia. We believe that the high quality of the event, the beautiful venue and the catering will make it worth that price. However, we know that means not everyone who wants to play will be able to afford a ticket. We also recognise that games like this benefit from having a full cast of characters and players from a diverse range of backgrounds.\r\nSo, we have made a small number of lower priced concession tickets available.\u00a0 If you are in a lower-income situation or are experiencing financial hardship and otherwise would not be able to afford a ticket, you can purchase one of those lower priced tickets. We're not going to check up on your financial situation. We trust you to be a mature and responsible adult and identify your need yourself. If you'd like us to make more of these tickets available you can buy the higher priced Prince Albert or Queen Victoria tickets. You won't get anything more for that tier of ticket (other than our thanks), but your higher ticket price will go directly towards subsidising someone else's ticket.\r\n",

Successful learning environments that come to life as \u2018laboratories for thinking\u2019 (Rinaldi) \u00a0are underpinned by collaborative evaluation and responsive design.\n\u00a0This workshop will allow teachers to consider important aspects of learning environment design and use with children aged 3- 8 years old.\u00a0\nWith a strongly collaborative focus for the workshop, teachers are asked to come ready to share and discuss elements of their own practice, which will add to the learning experience of the group.\nIn this workshop:\nParticipants will work collaboratively to understand how learning environments can:\n\n\nInvite inquiry learning and play\n\n\nSupport collaboration and shared meaning making\n\n\nExtend children\u2019s interests and honour their unique learning styles\n\n\nCelebrate our values\u00a0\n\n\nAct as the \u2018third teacher\u2019\n\n\nPromote wellbeing, learning and success\n\n\nBuild relationships and community\n\n\nThis workshop is suited to:\u00a0\nEarly Years Educators, Leaders and Curriculum Coordinators who have specific responsibility for the Early Years.\u00a0\nParticipants are asked to bring:\n\n\nA photograph of a place where they like to learn\n\n\n\n\nA photograph of their classroom environment\n\n\n\n\nA digital device for accessing shared resources\n\n\nWorkshop Presenter:\u00a0Fiona Zinn\nFiona Zinn\u00a0is an Early Childhood, Primary and Tertiary Educator with over 25 years experience in teaching and leadership within Australia and abroad.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe.
