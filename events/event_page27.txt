The Government\u2019s response to the Inquiry provided support for a legislative overhaul of the Environment Protection Act 1970 through two phases.

From 1 July 2018, this Act established EPA as an independent statutory authority and legislated a Governing Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Environmental Scientist. Completing the legislative overhaul is the Environment Protection Amendment Act 2018 (the Amendment Act) which amends the Environment Protection Act 2017 (the 2017 Act). The Amendment Act was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent in August 2018.\nThe Environment Protection Amendment Act is proposed to take effect in July 2020.

The interviews focused on values and ethical issues boards face and methods of dealing with them. The research found that most chairpersons tend to look at ethics via a specific lens (or two) and are less aware, nor take into consideration, other lenses. The Ethical Kaleidoscope amalgamates these lenses together into one framework that allows a holistic view of ethics in decision making and supports boards in proactively directing and governing ethical organisations.
