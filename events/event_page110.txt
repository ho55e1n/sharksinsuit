Your experience of life can be fuzzy and unsure,\u00a0blocked, or even frozen, not knowing quite what to do to break the pattern.

Mid size studios add people management and financial juggling to the mix. Either way, time is the most limited resource.\u00a0The Business of Design breakfasts give you 90 minutes of mentoring per month. We'll discuss ways to take control of your business. It's a meet-up limited to 20 like-minded designers, run by two of Australia\u2019s most experienced design business mentors. It's practical advice about topics such as time management through to find new business. \nAnd we always leave 15 minutes for AMA's: 'ask me anything'. Nothing is off-limits. Pick our brains about what we know about running an Australian design studio. If we don't know, we'll find out.\n\nI have been attending Carol and Greg\u2019s monthly breakfasts for two years. They are tremendously informative, inspiring and welcoming.\u00a0 Whether you are from a large design studio or sole operator, everyone\u2019s input is valued.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe sessions are very informal and relaxed, with plenty of opportunity for everyone to contribute to the discussion. Carol and Greg\u2019s expertise in design business and management is outstanding, between them they have got the whole field covered. Offering invaluable insights into their approach across all areas of design. I always leave with a new nugget of practical information that I can easily apply to my business. \n\n\nAdele Del Signore, Frank Design Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\nContent of each session\nThe content is driven by the participants. If you have a challenge, bring it along so we can discuss solutions.\nWe've talked through challenges like self promotion: how to identify what your studio does differently to another. And how to write a design value proposition so you can articulate your different to a client. And of course new business. How to develop a sustainable new business strategy. How you can keep the clients you have an find new ones.\nAsk me anything: The last 15 minutes of the session is your chance to ask Greg and Carol any question you have about managing a design business.\nIn the month after this breakfast we work with you via email to develop your strategy.\nFAQs \nWho are Carol and Greg?\nGreg Branson and Carol Mackay are co-founders of the Design Business Council. Together they ran Mackay Branson design before using that experience to found DBC.\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nThe Moat is across the road from a parking venue (under QV). It is 100 mts from a tram stop in Swantston street and 300 mts from the Melbourne Central underground station. \nWhat do I need to bring into the event?\nBring any questions you might have and something to take notes.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nPlease email carol - at - designbusinesscouncil.com with any further questions.\nWhat's the refund policy?\nWe understand that time commitments change at the last moment, deadlines loom, and clients yell, but as we need to commit to numbers for the Alex, a refund is only available 7 days out from the event. Your ticket is transferable. If you get stuck, perhaps there's someone else that may be interested in attending in your place?\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nNo, once we have you registered your place is confirmed.\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?\nYes, we understand that commitments change. Feel free to transfer your ticket to someone else if you are no longer able to attend. We would appreciate you letting us know. ",

                "text": "\u00a0\r\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to RCM3\u2122 and its principles. It is intended for those who wish to reduce operational and maintenance risks while securing optimum performance from physical assets, from the viewoint of safety, environmental integrity, output, product quality or customer service.\r\nThis course walks participants through the RCM3 process \u2013 the next generation RCM \u2013 and extends the thought process and rigor of our robust RCM2\u2122 methodology. RCM3 is applied when asset owners want to reduce the operational and maintenance risks associated with their physical assets to achieve the inherent safety and reliability capabilities of assets at a minimum cost.\r\nDuring the three-day course, you will learn the fundamentals of modern physical asset performance management and highlight the business case for reliability. Today more than ever there is a burning need to increase asset performance while reducing costs. This is not a new concept as a typical asset undergoes between 30 and 50 reliability, maintenance and production optimization initiatives per year. A key to ensuring success is to shift from the conventional repair and modification approaches to a focus on risk mitigation \u2013 the core principle of RCM3.\r\nRCM3 is used to define your maintenance strategy and other engineering, operations and business strategies. A central problem addressed with RCM3 is how to determine which maintenance tasks, if any, should be applied to an item and how frequently assigned tasks should be accomplished. The content of this three-day course can be readily assimilated by maintenance and operations people at all levels. The course teaches you to apply best practices to answering the nine questions of RCM3 using a case study approach. The group explores the steps and issues concerning the application and implementation of the analysis to ensure that the desired benefits are attained.\r\nBy Participating You Will Learn How RCM3:\r\n\r\nHelps you develop your risk management strategies\r\nHelps you select tasks that are technically feasible and worth doing\r\nFocuses on the reality of failure\r\nEnsures understanding and cooperation between operations and maintenance for successful asset management\r\nProvides a common language and a common set of values for maintenance and operations\r\nAbove all, enables organisations to make the right asset management choices for optimal equipment performance\r\nPuts maintenance with international standards such as ISO 55000 for physical asset management and ISO 31000 for risk management\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nKPMG Australia Engineering Consulting Pty Ltd Workshop Terms and Conditions\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\r\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These Terms apply to your participation in, and attendance at, in the Workshop and set out our respective responsibilities, rights and obligations.\r\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These Terms contain the entire understanding between you and us in relation to the Workshop.\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0KPMG Australia Engineering\u00a0Consulting Workshop (Workshop)\r\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Workshop will be held at KPMG\u2019s Melbourne office.\r\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Workshop will provide information, training, workshop materials and feedback of a general nature (the Services).\r\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You agree and acknowledge that the Services provided to you in the Workshop are of a general nature and are not intended to address your specific circumstances.

It is intended for those who wish to reduce operational and maintenance risks while securing optimum performance from physical assets, from the viewoint of safety, environmental integrity, output, product quality or customer service.</P>\r\n<P>This course walks participants through the RCM3 process \u2013 the next generation RCM \u2013 and extends the thought process and rigor of our robust RCM2\u2122 methodology. RCM3 is applied when asset owners want to reduce the operational and maintenance risks associated with their physical assets to achieve the inherent safety and reliability capabilities of assets at a minimum cost.</P>\r\n<P>During the three-day course, you will learn the fundamentals of modern physical asset performance management and highlight the business case for reliability. Today more than ever there is a burning need to increase asset performance while reducing costs. This is not a new concept as a typical asset undergoes between 30 and 50 reliability, maintenance and production optimization initiatives per year. A key to ensuring success is to shift from the conventional repair and modification approaches to a focus on risk mitigation \u2013 the core principle of RCM3.</P>\r\n<P>RCM3 is used to define your maintenance strategy and other engineering, operations and business strategies. A central problem addressed with RCM3 is how to determine which maintenance tasks, if any, should be applied to an item and how frequently assigned tasks should be accomplished. The content of this three-day course can be readily assimilated by maintenance and operations people at all levels. The course teaches you to apply best practices to answering the nine questions of RCM3 using a case study approach. The group explores the steps and issues concerning the application and implementation of the analysis to ensure that the desired benefits are attained.</P>\r\n<P>By Participating You Will Learn How RCM3:</P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Helps you develop your risk management strategies</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Helps you select tasks that are technically feasible and worth doing</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Focuses on the reality of failure</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Ensures understanding and cooperation between operations and maintenance for successful asset management</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Provides a common language and a common set of values for maintenance and operations</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Above all, enables organisations to make the right asset management choices for optimal equipment performance</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Puts maintenance with international standards such as ISO 55000 for physical asset management and ISO 31000 for risk management</SPAN></LI>\r\n</UL>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><B>KPMG Australia Engineering Consulting Pty Ltd Workshop Terms and Conditions</B></SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><B>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction</B></SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">a)<SPAN>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </SPAN>These Terms apply to your participation in, and attendance at, in the Workshop and set out our respective responsibilities, rights and obligations.</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">b)<SPAN>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </SPAN>These Terms contain the entire understanding between you and us in relation to the Workshop.</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><B>2.\u00a0\u00a0<B><SPAN>KPMG Australia Engineering\u00a0Consulting Workshop (Workshop)</SPAN></B></B></SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>a)<SPAN>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </SPAN>Workshop will be held at KPMG\u2019s Melbourne office.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>b)<SPAN>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </SPAN>The Workshop will provide information, training, workshop materials and feedback of a general nature (the Services).</SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>c)<SPAN>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </SPAN>You agree and acknowledge that the Services provided to you in the Workshop are of a general nature and are not intended to address your specific circumstances.

Rather than trying to cover all 17 goals in a day, students focus on a smaller interconnected set of goals relevant to the challenge at hand, namely Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.
