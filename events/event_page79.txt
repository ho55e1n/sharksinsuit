I have so much more confidence presenting in front of an audience that I have since gone on to achieve amazing success speaking to a room full of people about my personal story. If it wasn't for Janelle, I would have never volunteered to not step, but leap outside my comfort zone and speak up about domestic violence. Thank you for empowering me to become the best version of myself.\u201d\r\nChelsea Dolby Executive Regional Vice President Arbonne\u00a0 Australia & New Zealand\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u201cWow! Janelle and her courses are outstanding. The content and delivery far exceeded my expectations. The positive impact on my business, even after implementing just a fraction of what I have learnt from her, has been amazing and so rewarding. I'm super excited to continue on the journey of growth and continue implementing her teachings.\u201d\r\nYvette Timmins Director Bloom College\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u201cJanelle's course is more than just a speaker course. It takes you on a journey of self discovery both personally and professionally. You are stretched way beyond your comfort zone and find yourself confronted with challenges that you never thought you would overcome. Even though I had delivered training and spoken at events in the past, I feel that I am now more than 10 times better at presenting. And much to Janelle's delight (and amazing support), I no longer need my PowerPoint 'crutch'! I highly recommend taking the time to challenge yourself with this course.\u201d\r\nCarli Saw\u00a0 Director Strawberry Seed Consulting\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u201cAs a real estate agent who speaks everyday I have picked up bad habits of talking fast and sometimes speaking too much with my hands. I took Janelle's Speaker workshop as I wanted to refine how I spoke during presentations and to learn to slow things down. I can honestly say she was fantastic. I learnt how to stand strong, relax more and deliver my message more clearly. I would highly recommend trying one of her workshops or consulting her for a one on one as she will only add value and you will come out a better speaker 100%. Thanks JJ.\u201d\r\nStacey Hayes Director/ Sales Hayeswinckle Real Estate\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Before doing the speaker course with Janelle I was nervous and afraid of not only public speaking, but approaching people at networking events.

Participants up to the ages of 85 are covered by Council's Personal Accident Insurance policy, but participants older than 85 years are NOT covered and participate at their own risk.

Consider if you need to bring a rain jacket or a sun-smart hat. Bring a drink bottle (water, tea and coffee will be provided) and your own packed lunch if you have any special dietary requirements (a simple BBQ lunch or pizzas are catered for lunch, with fruit snacks).\nAll of the other tools, equipment and materials required will be provided by Council, including gloves and sunscreen.\u00a0\nWhen will events be cancelled?\nGreening events will cancelled if there is bad weather forecast, including heavy rain, thunderstorms or gale force winds. However light drizzling rain is great planting weather and the event will go ahead if people arrive (check the rain radar on http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR023.loop.shtml#skip).\nCouncil staff are normally out on site about an hour before the event commences, setting up.\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nContact Melissa Doherty, Urban Biodiversity Officer at Hume City Council\n9205 2466 0409 702 086 melissado@hume.vic.gov.au\n",
