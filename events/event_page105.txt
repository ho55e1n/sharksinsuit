Supporting him is Berlin artist meggy, and homegrown talent Made in Paris and Jordan Brando. This event will take place in The Wool Store, Footscray - an iconic 1940s warehouse which has great regional, historical, architectural and cultural significance. As one of the largest single wool store buildings in Victoria, built on a grand scale with considerable architectural refinement, it played a key role in the post-war wool boom which fuelled Australia's economy at the time. From outside the colossal building, one sees an iconic 1940s warehouse located in the inner-city location of West Footscray, however, within these walls you are transported out of Melbourne suburbia and into the European warehouse rave scene, where underground electronic music reigns and limits are constantly being pushed.Untitled Group are dedicated to doing this monument justice, fitting it with a new world-class sound system paired with their signature meticulously curated production & set designs. Outside, patrons will find a contrasting open aired garden courtyard that will play host to the best in local talent as well as a complimenting contingent of art installations and food and beverage offerings.Jamie Jones:World renowned DJ and producer, Hot Creations label boss, founder and curator of the Paradise global event series and a member of cross-genre band Hot Natured, Jamie Jones, has pioneered his own distinct sound that has paved the way for a warmer, more melodic, side of techno to emerge. It was DJs Can Dance - the East London warehouse parties he threw in the mid 00\u2019s - that helped him make his mark on the capital, while the countless summers spent playing in Ibiza solidified him as an integral cog in the island\u2019s music scene.To date, Jamie\u2019s label Hot Creations has put out over 100 releases, with the 100th, \u2018Kooky Chords\u2019, coming from Jamie himself last September, hitting the number 2 spot on Beatport\u2019s chart. The label has also helped launch the careers of numerous artists such as Patrick Topping, Richy Ahmed and Detlef, who also make up part of the loyal Paradise family Jamie has built around him.Join us this May, for what is set to be one to go down in the books. \n................................................................Facebook: Untitled GroupInstagram: @untitledgroupauWebsite: www.untitledgroup.com.au\n\nTICKETING INFO & TERMS:\n\nAll sales are final.

At this event, participants pair-up one after the other with everyone else of the other gender, to explore a simple fun and creative experiential exercise as the \u2018speed-date\u2019.  Each of these 'dates' is a simple, fun and/or interesting (facilitated) M/F pair-interaction with no verbal dialogue - an easy authentic expression game, or a simple (non-erotic) Tantra connection practice. A range from the playful to the gently resonant.  Then each date then closes with a couple of minutes to chat in your pair about how you experienced the exercise. (Random conversations are NOT part of dates. We have free-form social space at the end of the event.)  This event will particularly suit people who are interested in meeting others in ways that are creative, spiritual, intuitive, alternative, or otherwise a little 'outside of the box'.  It's a dating event AND a 'non-verbal relating skills' workshop combined!! (Yes, you still confidentially tick someone's name if you would like to connect with them again, and are notified of matches within a day or so afterwards.)\n\nFor more details please check out the facebook event:\u00a0www.facebook.com/events/470436083340241\nOr the Conscious Speed Dating website: www.csdmelbourne.weebly.com",

You\u2019ll be able to pay for all food, drink and merch quickly and easily using your credit, debit or EFTPOS card at all bars, exhibitor stands and food vendors.

Please make sure to bring your payWave or PayPass card, or any device with Apple Pay or Google Pay, along with your ticket and ID, and you\u2019re all set.\nI\u2019m a My Dan Murphy\u2019s customer. How do I redeem my discount?\nPlease check your inbox for an email from the My Dan Murphy\u2019s team with a unique code to redeem your My Dan Murphy\u2019s benefits.\nI have a promo code. How do I use it?\nOoh, lucky you! When you click the green \u2018Tickets\u2019 button, a box will appear with all the ticket types.

If not there, please login to your Eventbrite account and check your account to see if you entered the correct email address.\nCan you resend my ticket(s)?\nYou can reprint your own tickets from Eventbrite. Please login to your account, go to \u2018Tickets\u2019, select the tickets then reprint them. If you have any issues, please email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer\u00a0with the details.\nCan I transfer my ticket to another session?\nIf you have a Single Session ticket, you can change your session by logging onto your Eventbrite account and under \u2018Tickets\u2019 clicking the transfer icon. For more details on how to do this please visit the\u00a0transfer information page. Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.\nBeer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.\nI\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?\nUnfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.\nCan I give my ticket to someone else?\nIf you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.\nCan people under 18 attend?\nIn Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.\nWhat happens when I get there?\nOn arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in. Season Pass ticket holders will be given Season Pass accreditation, which must be shown when entering each session.\nPlease be prepared to show your valid ID. Please note all bags are subject to inspection at any point during the event. Bottles, cans, glass, food, drink, alcohol, illicit drugs, illegal substances, fireworks, explosives or anything that can be used as a weapon cannot be brought into the festival.\nAs you enter, you\u2019ll be given a Festival Glass and your Official GABS Guide. And then you\u2019re good to go!\nI have applied to be a volunteer. Do I need to purchase a ticket?\nGreat work. We love our volunteers! All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).\nWill tickets sell out?\nThe majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.\nWhat if I don\u2019t have proof of age?\nGABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.\nWhen do the bars close?\nAll bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.\nWhat sort of behaviour is unacceptable?\nIf anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.\nI have a question that\u2019s not answered here.\nPlease read through the GABS\u00a0website\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there. Alternatively, please feel free to message us on Facebook or email\u00a0contact@gabs.beer.\nPlease note that by purchasing a ticket to GABS 2019, you consent to any photos of you at the event to be used for future marketing purposes. If you prefer us not to use your photo, please get in touch us at\u00a0contact@gabs.beer\u00a0and we\u2019ll make sure this happens.\nAs a ticket buyer, you will automatically be opted in to receive the GABS News email newsletter.

For more details on how to do this please visit the\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.eventbrite.com.au/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-transfer-to-a-different-event-or-ticket-type?lg=en_US\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noopener noreferrer\">transfer information page</A>. Please note transfers are subject to ticket availability and tickets cannot be transferred to a sold out session.</P>\n<P>Beer buddy tickets are non-transferable unfortunately, please select your session carefully before purchasing group tickets.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I\u2019ve changed my mind. Can I get a refund?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Unfortunately refunds on tickets are unavailable. Please consider carefully before completing your ticket purchase.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can I give my ticket to someone else?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If you\u2019re unable to use your tickets, they can be transferred to another person. We don\u2019t need to update the name on the ticket as we simply scan the barcode.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can people under 18 attend?</STRONG></P>\n<P>In Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, people under 18 are welcome to attend the event. Please note that a valid ticket is still required, and all attendees under the age of 18 will be required to wear a wristband for the duration of their stay at GABS. Children under the age of 12 can attend the event for free and don\u2019t require a ticket.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What happens when I get there?</STRONG></P>\n<P>On arrival, your ticket will be scanned and you\u2019ll be able to head straight in. Season Pass ticket holders will be given Season Pass accreditation, which must be shown when entering each session.</P>\n<P>Please be prepared to show your valid ID. Please note all bags are subject to inspection at any point during the event. Bottles, cans, glass, food, drink, alcohol, illicit drugs, illegal substances, fireworks, explosives or anything that can be used as a weapon cannot be brought into the festival.</P>\n<P>As you enter, you\u2019ll be given a Festival Glass and your Official GABS Guide. And then you\u2019re good to go!</P>\n<P><STRONG>I have applied to be a volunteer. Do I need to purchase a ticket?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Great work. We love our volunteers! All volunteers, once approved by our team and appointed a role, will be given a unique code to redeem two complimentary General Admission tickets to a session of their choice. Please note this ticket must be for a session held on a different day (or if on the same day, after the volunteer session).</P>\n<P><STRONG>Will tickets sell out?</STRONG></P>\n<P>The majority of GABS sessions will sell out. If in doubt, best to purchase your ticket as early as possible.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What if I don\u2019t have proof of age?</STRONG></P>\n<P>GABS reserves the right to refuse service of alcohol to anyone unable to prove their age. No ticket refunds will be provided in this occurrence.</P>\n<P><STRONG>When do the bars close?</STRONG></P>\n<P>All bars serving alcohol will close 15 minutes before the advertised closing time of each GABS session.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What sort of behaviour is unacceptable?</STRONG></P>\n<P>If anyone thinks GABS is a swillathon, they will only be disappointed. While GABS is all about responsible beer appreciation and education in a fun and festive atmosphere, anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.</P>\n<P><STRONG>I have a question that\u2019s not answered here.</STRONG></P>\n<P>Please read through the GABS\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.gabsfestival.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">website</A>\u00a0to see if there\u2019s an answer there.
