                "text": "\nJoin Daya Prakash as she guides through this enlightening Workshop is devoted to helping you release the past and open your heart to call in a divine partner. If you already have a soul mate this workshop will help you deepen your relationship.\n\n\nBoth men and women have masculine and feminine qualities, so these mantras apply to all.Women have the extra arcline that is located from nipple to nipple in addition to the arcline across the brow. This additional arcline holds the imprint of past relationships; it also to the mother\u2019s relationship with her baby. By clearing this second arcline, you\u2019ll stop pining for lovers past, and focus on calling in your divine true love.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to call in your true love partner if you\u2019re mired in the past.These mantras can be used in contemporary times for everyone, not just for traditional male/female couples.\n\n\n\n\n\n The second Arcline is extremely sensitive in it\u2019s ability to perceive, protect, and project. In fact, the Arcline is so sensitive that is said that when two people smile at one another, there is a spark of connection generated between the two Arclines that can be tapped into for deep healing. And as sensitive as the Arcline is to even a shared smile, any sexual encounter is deeply felt in the Arcline for Anytime a woman has sex, the Arclines imprint on one another and she takes on the karma of the man. The blending of the Arclines through sexual experience can be destructive to the woman\u2019s own identity, as her energy field becomes blended with those of her sexual partners. In the age of Tinder and Bumble, I find many women are struggling with their self-identity and feel that this is intimately connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust knowing that the Arcline contains our destiny, our karma, our subconscious garbage, and the imprint of every sexual encounter we\u2019ve ever had, it becomes essential to keep practices that can clear away some of the crap to make space for more clarity and true connection.\n\n\nIn Kundalini Yoga, we have meditations that involve moving the hands and arms through the Arclines to clear and charge them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Workshop we will be using mantra's and Kundalini mediations to clear and call in our Soulmate.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a mediation to clear the arcline and Karma and The Cross Heart Kirtan Kyria two very powerful mediations that will change your destiny\n\n\n\n\n\nOne mantra we will be working with is \u201cMangala Saag Bhai-aa,\u201d from Shabd by Satkirin Kaur Khalsa.The mantra is specifically used to call in a divine soul mate and overcome loneliness. It\u2019s about the yearning for unconditional, permanent, forever love, unifying with the divine and with your significant other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next mantra is So Purkh. This mantra can be chanted for up to three men at a time (e.g. father, brother, son). It releases a woman\u2019s karma around men, clears the imprints of karmic relationships, and helps to elevate the men for whom you are reciting the mantra. Like the previous mantra, it also helps clear the arcline.\n\n\nLearning to deepen into love for yourself is another part of calling love to your life. Honor yourself, and recognize your grace and lovability. \u201cI Am Grace of God\u201d connects with that \u201cLet this sink into your subconscious and infuse you with the warmth of self-honor,\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arcline exists as a halo of energy, stretching from ear to ear over the crown of the head. If you\u2019ve ever seen a Byzantine depiction of Christ in paintings, the halo of light surrounding his head is a similar visualisation of this Light Body.\n\n\nOur Arcline is our connection to the divine \u2014 when strong, the Universe delivers. We strengthen the Arcline with committed, steady practice (Sadhana), being in community (Sangat), and through the power of prayer. Having a strong Arcline gives us the presence and desire to serve humanity in action; it gives us balance in word and deed. When weak, we are easily influenced by others, ineffective, inconsistent in mood and behavior, and unable to focus or manifest our prayers.\n\n\nOur Arclines hold an imprint of our karmic records and thus is connected to our immune system, due to the relationship between karma and illness. All of the subconscious garbage that we accumulate also rests in our Arcline, potentially dampening our radiance and prosperity. This is one of the reasons we practice, to actively clear away the crap that gets stuck in our energy fields.\n\n\nAccording to ancient yogic scriptures, women are sixteen times more intuitive, intelligent, patient, and compassionate then men\n\nThere is a minium of 5 people to run the workshop, if in the case we do onit have 5 people we will postpone to a later date.\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nPlease bring water and wear comfortable clothes. Please eat a light meal the day of and no consumption of alcohol the day off.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

The field itself is changing very quickly, with interesting developments every day. This workshop is aimed to give you a complete introduction to Deep Learning. At the end of the workshop, you will have (a) a better understanding/appreciation of deep learning, (b) a better understanding of problem-domains that can be solved by DL, (c) build deep learning solution using TensorFlow.\u00a0Main topics include, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep ANN, AutoEncoders, Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM, Attention-based methods, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Auto-encoders, Deep Reinforcement Learning, etc.\nWhy you should attend? You will learn:\nHow Facebook tags you and your friends in pictures?\nHow Google translates from English to Chinese?\nHow AlphaGo learned to play Atari games beating humans?\nHow Chatbots learn to mimic a human?\nHow can you do superior time series analysis?\nEtc. Etc.\nMotivations\nOutside academia, not many comprehensive Deep Learning courses exists. This course is aimed to bridge the gap between current Deep Learning (research and developments) and other stake-holders that can greatly benefit from Deep Learning techniques.\nWhat this course is not?\nThis workshop is not a training of the use of Deep Learning libraries. We expect some very basic understanding of Machine Learning, however, some proficiency with Python or R programming languages. This workshop is training in underlying deep learning methodologies, fundamental concepts and algorithms that every data scientists should be familiar with. Of course, we illustrate and demonstrate all concepts in TensorFlow (with Python Jupyter notebooks).\nDuration\n1 day (9 hours)\nTraining Breakdown\n(*) Note the unit breakdown in the following is likely to change, but it provides a general overview of the topics that this training will cover.\nModule\nSession 1 -- Introduction\n\nIntroduction to Machine Learning\n\nLinear/Logistic Regression\nOptimization\n\nGradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\nBias-Variance Trade-off, Under-fitting/Over-fitting\nNeed for low-bias vs. low-variance Models in ML\n\nArtificial Neural Networks\n\nGradients\nRegularization -- Dropoff\nModel Architecture\n\nDeep Learning\nRepresentation Learning\n\nSession 2 --\u00a0Auto-Encoders and Deep Belief Networks\n\nUnsupervised ANN\nRestricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)\nAuto-Encoders (AE)\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nSingular-value-Decomposition (SVD)\nAutoEncoders Architecture\n\nSparse Auto-encoders\nDeep Belief Nets\n\nSession 3 --\u00a0Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n\nIntroduction\n\nConvolution\nFeature Maps, Max Pooling\nBatch Normalization\n\nCNN Architectures\nFace Recognition\n\nTriplet Loss\n\nCNN for non-images\n\nSession 4 --\u00a0Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n\nIntroduction\n\nVarious Architectures\nApplications\n\nRNN Embeddings\nLSTM, GRU\nAttention-based models\n\nTransformers\n\nBuilding Chatbots\n\nSession 5 --\u00a0Generative Neural Networks\n\nIntroduction\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\nVariational Auto-Encoders\n\nSession 6 -- Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nIntroduction\n\nLearning Optimal Policies\n\nQ-Learning\n\nDeep Q-Learning (DQN)\nDouble Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)\n\nPolicy-based Methods\n\nPolicy-gradient Method\n\n\nSession 7 -- Networking\n\nSalient Features\nComprehensive and State-of-the-art training in Data Analytics\nSmall Group -- Max 15. Opportunity to meet and mingle\nOpportunity for a lot of group discussions and a chance to talk about your own work for 5 minutes in front of the group\nFrequent Questions\nWhy should I attend this course?\nGood question! Let us ask you some counter questions.\n\n1) Are you interested in exploring Deep Learning with some breath and depth?\n\n\n2) Are you curious about the inner workings of deep learning algorithms?\n\n\n3) Do you want to understand how Google Translate works? Converting English into Flemish, Chinese into Afrikaans, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n4) Working out on a chatbot technology -- trying to understand how it works?\u00a0\n\n\n5) Curious about inner working of reinforcement learning, and how alpha-Go learns to play Atari games better than humans?\u00a0\n\n\n5) How computers recognize faces or Facebook tags you automatically in an image?\u00a0\n\nIf answer to any of the above questions is yes, then you should attend this course.\nHow is this course different from others?\nThere are not many courses on Deep Learning, most are offered as part of post-graduate degree or diploma by universities. Non-academic units have a too narrow focus on certain technologies, for example, 'Deep Learning with Theano or Torch'. The extra layer of technology around the algorithms confuses the underlying message.We have designed this course around the core concepts and fundamental principles -- conveyed in a total technology agnostic way. The underlying concepts are taught through mathematical notations.\nDo I need a deep Math background?\nNot deep. But you should be familiar with some basic statistics, Linear Algebra and Calculus. We will try our best to explain the foundations, but sometimes, time may not permit. We will post some foundation slides on 'Reading List' of this web page.\nDo I need to bring my laptop?\nYes, there is a lab component in most of the lectures. It will be beneficial if you bring your laptop, to run this code on your computer.\nDo I need to know computer programming?\nYes. Some computer programming experience is required if you are interested in implementing some of the ideas in the workshop.\nI am not a Python programmer?\nThat is absolutely fine. Keep checking the 'Reading List' section on this web page -- we will share some 'Introduction to Python' lectures. If you are an R/Matlab programmer, we encourage you to get yourself familiarize with Python syntax before coming to the workshop.\nWhat does course-kit consist of?\n\n1) Book consisting of printed slides (over 200 pages)\n\n\n2) Certificate of Attendance (posted in 2-3 weeks after attendance), if requested\n\n\n3) Welcome pack\n\nWho will deliver this unit?\nThis course will delivered by a 'Principle Data Scientist' (highest designation at DataSmelly) -- the coordinator will have a Ph.D in Machine Learning or related area and over six years of research and development experience.",

Of course, we illustrate and demonstrate all concepts in TensorFlow (with Python Jupyter notebooks).</P>\n<H2 CLASS=\"p1\"><STRONG>Duration</STRONG></H2>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">1 day (9 hours)</SPAN></P>\n<H2 CLASS=\"p1\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Training Breakdown</SPAN></H2>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">(*) Note the unit breakdown in the following is likely to change, but it provides a general overview of the topics that this training will cover.</SPAN></P>\n<H2 CLASS=\"p1\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Module</SPAN></H2>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 1 -- Introduction</SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Introduction to Machine Learning</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Linear/Logistic Regression</LI>\n<LI>Optimization</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Bias-Variance Trade-off, Under-fitting/Over-fitting</LI>\n<LI>Need for low-bias vs. low-variance Models in ML</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Artificial Neural Networks</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Gradients</LI>\n<LI>Regularization -- Dropoff</LI>\n<LI>Model Architecture</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Deep Learning</LI>\n<LI>Representation Learning</LI>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 2 --\u00a0<SPAN>Auto-Encoders and Deep Belief Networks</SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Unsupervised ANN</LI>\n<LI>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)</LI>\n<LI>Auto-Encoders (AE)</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</LI>\n<LI>Singular-value-Decomposition (SVD)</LI>\n<LI>AutoEncoders Architecture</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Sparse Auto-encoders</LI>\n<LI>Deep Belief Nets</LI>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 3 --\u00a0<SPAN>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Introduction</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Convolution</LI>\n<LI>Feature Maps, Max Pooling</LI>\n<LI>Batch Normalization</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>CNN Architectures</LI>\n<LI>Face Recognition</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Triplet Loss</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>CNN for non-images</LI>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 4 --\u00a0<SPAN>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Introduction</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Various Architectures</LI>\n<LI>Applications</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>RNN Embeddings</LI>\n<LI>LSTM, GRU</LI>\n<LI>Attention-based models</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Transformers</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Building Chatbots</LI>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 5 --\u00a0<SPAN>Generative Neural Networks</SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Introduction</LI>\n<LI>Generative Adversarial Networks</LI>\n<LI>Variational Auto-Encoders</LI>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 6 -- <SPAN>Deep Reinforcement Learning</SPAN></SPAN></H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Introduction</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Learning Optimal Policies</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Q-Learning</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Deep Q-Learning (DQN)</LI>\n<LI>Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)</LI>\n</UL>\n<LI>Policy-based Methods</LI>\n<UL>\n<LI>Policy-gradient Method</LI>\n</UL>\n</UL>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Session 7 -- Networking</SPAN></H3>\n<H3 CLASS=\"p2\"><BR></H3>\n<H2 CLASS=\"p1\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">Salient Features</SPAN></H2>\n<P>Comprehensive and State-of-the-art training in Data Analytics</P>\n<P>Small Group -- Max 15.

Let us ask you some counter questions.</P>\n<UL>\n<UL>1) Are you interested in exploring Deep Learning with some breath and depth?</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>2) Are you curious about the inner workings of deep learning algorithms?</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>3) Do you want to understand how Google Translate works? Converting English into Flemish, Chinese into Afrikaans, etc.\u00a0</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>4) Working out on a chatbot technology -- trying to understand how it works?\u00a0</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>5) Curious about inner working of reinforcement learning, and how alpha-Go learns to play Atari games better than humans?\u00a0</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>5) How computers recognize faces or Facebook tags you automatically in an image?\u00a0</UL>\n</UL>\n<P><SPAN>If answer to any of the above questions is yes, then you should attend this course.</SPAN><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><STRONG>How is this course different from others?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN>There are not many courses on Deep Learning, most are offered as part of post-graduate degree or diploma by universities. Non-academic units have a too narrow focus on certain technologies, for example, 'Deep Learning with Theano or Torch'. The extra layer of technology around the algorithms confuses the underlying message.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>We have designed this course around the core concepts and fundamental principles -- conveyed in a total technology agnostic way. The underlying concepts are taught through mathematical notations.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><STRONG>Do I need a deep Math background?<BR></STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN>Not deep. But you should be familiar with some basic statistics, Linear Algebra and Calculus. We will try our best to explain the foundations, but sometimes, time may not permit. We will post some foundation slides on 'Reading List' of this web page.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><STRONG>Do I need to bring my laptop?<BR></STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN>Yes, there is a lab component in most of the lectures. It will be beneficial if you bring your laptop, to run this code on your computer.</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>Do I need to know computer programming?</STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>Yes. Some computer programming experience is required if you are interested in implementing some of the ideas in the workshop.</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>I am not a Python programmer?</STRONG><BR></P>\n<P><SPAN>That is absolutely fine. Keep checking the 'Reading List' section on this web page -- we will share some 'Introduction to Python' lectures. If you are an R/Matlab programmer, we encourage you to get yourself familiarize with Python syntax before coming to the workshop.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><STRONG>What does course-kit consist of?</STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<UL>1) Book consisting of printed slides (over 200 pages)</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>2) Certificate of Attendance (posted in 2-3 weeks after attendance), if requested</UL>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<UL>3) Welcome pack</UL>\n</UL>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><STRONG>Who will deliver this unit?</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p3\"><SPAN CLASS=\"s1\">This course will delivered by a 'Principle Data Scientist' (highest designation at DataSmelly) -- the coordinator will have a Ph.D in Machine Learning or related area and over six years of research and development experience.</SPAN></P>"

The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized\u00a0Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification\u00a0exam.\nUnlike the\u00a0Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course\u00a0which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM II is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.\nWho Should Attend\nThe Professional Scrum Master II course is an advanced course specifically designed for experienced Scrum Masters who have a thorough understanding of the Scrum framework. \u00a0It is particularly beneficial for those people with at least one year of Scrum Master experience.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nOver the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Scrum Master such as how the principles and values of Scrum help guide Scrum Masters in the decisions they make and how the Scrum Master can help change the environment of Scrum Teams, creating an environment for agility to thrive.\u00a0The Scrum Master role is complex and often, a Scrum Master must be able to apply different stances in order to be effective, such as:\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Teacher\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Facilitator\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Change Agent\n\n\nAs a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.\nAs a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent. \u00a0Throughout the class, your PST will provide\u00a0stories,\u00a0exercises, facilitation techniques (such as \u201cLiberating Structures\u201d), resources and more.\nThere will also be time in class for the Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) to provide coaching on challenges that you and\u00a0your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy Scrum.org\nScrum.org provides the highest quality Scrum training, training materials and certified Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to teach them. Our training materials are created and maintained by Scrum co-creator Ken Schwaber, Scrum.org and the community of PSTs who teach the courses, helping to ensure that they are in tune with what\u2019s happening in software development organizations and always up-to-date with the latest practices.\nProfessional Scrum Trainers bring their own style and experience to the courses, but use the same materials so that students are learning from the same content regardless of who teaches the course or where it is taught around the world. \u00a0Read more\u00a0about the differences.\nYour Trainer - Rich Visotcky\n\"It is my mission to help people leverage different perspectives and new approaches to connect with what is truly important in their situation and solve the challenges they are facing. I love to connect people with the principles behind leaner, agile processes and practices so they build elastic skills and adaptable approaches to deal with evolving challenges.\nI'm a seasoned agile trainer and coach, Professional Scrum Trainer with Scrum.org, one of two stewards for the Professional Scrum Foundations course, and Management 3.0 facilitator bringing years of experience in helping hundreds of people learn agile concepts and put them into practice in their daily work and lives.\"\n\nhttps://www.scrum.org/rich-visotcky\n\n",

                "text": "Red Teaming - The Advanced Userland Techniques\nRed Teaming \"The Advanced User-Land Techniques\" imparts user-land exploitation techniques specifically designed to evade advanced enterprise security products, as well as make incident detection and response a real nightmare. Students will practice Red Teaming against a network with hundreds of machines, containing multiple VLANs, and which are properly defended by endpoint detection, response and defence-in-depth.\nAmong the many topics covered are:\n\n\nComplete malware platform covering web, mobile, endpoint and network\n\n\nRapid deployment of command control infrastructure in the cloud\n\n\nData exfiltration techniques for segmented enterprise networks\n\n\nOperational security and tripwires to detect security investigations\n\n\nAnti-forensics and anti-threat-hunting concepts and techniques\n\n\nTotal enterprise network compromise including SCADA and ERP\n\n\nTheoretical knowledge makes up 40% of the course, and 60% is made up of practical exercises. The last day of the course is a practical Red Team exercise where students will put the skills they have learnt into practice.\nCourse Outcomes:\nIn this course, we teach similar attack techniques used by threat actors such as APT28, Project Sauron, or DUBNIUM, to compromise networks.\nIf you are a penetration tester, the knowledge imparted in this course will assist you to deliver long-term Red Team campaigns that simulate persistent attackers equipped with advanced user-land exploitation toolsets. If you work in incident detection and response, this course will show you how the adversaries are defeating many enterprise security solutions and provide you with insights on what can be done to stop them. Throughout the course, we will show the students the forensics artefacts they are generating on the network that could allow the incident response team to detect them.\nSyllabus\nhttps://www.mosse-security.com/master-courses/red-teaming-advanced-userland-techniques-master-course.html\nIntended Audience\nPenetration testers, incident responders, security analysts, security engineers and heads of information security with strong technical background are all welcome to attend this course.\nInstructor(s)\nThis course is taught by experienced Moss\u00e9 Security\u2019s instructors. Our instructors have over 10 years of experience delivering penetration testing, red teaming and incident response services for a multitude of industries that have involved complex and multi-faceted approaches. Our instructors each possess the right balance of corporate experience and are competently skilled in presenting and teaching to groups.Beyond their technical abilities and years of professional experience, our instructors are also trained teachers and public speakers.
