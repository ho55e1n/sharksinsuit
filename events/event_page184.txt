The 3MT is an international competition which asks research students to present a compelling three minute oration on their thesis topic, and its significance, in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience \u2013 using a single PowerPoint slide. In this workshop we watch videos of 3MT winners (and losers) and you get to work on your own pitch. At the end of this workshop you will have the outline of an elevator speech and, probably, greater clarity on your thesis too.\nThis sessions is faciliteted by Associate Professor Inger Mewburn, aka the\u00a0Thesis Whisperer, an expert in research communication.\u00a0Find out more about 3MT\u00a0here.\n100% of participants surveyed in 2017 recommend this presentation to their peers. Participants said:\n\"I like how there were examples of previous presentations and the discussions that ensued. This would otherwise have not happened if you were watching them by yourself. And it was very relevant and helpful as well.\"\u00a0\n\"I'm now excited about being involved and developing my skills!\"\nStrictly limited places.Click\u00a0here\u00a0for a map to this session\u2019s location.If you have any questions, please contact the\u00a0ANU Research Skills and Training team on\u00a0researchtraining@anu.edu.au\nBy registering for this event, you are committing to attendance.

The 3MT is an international competition which asks research students to present a compelling three minute oration on their thesis topic, and its significance, in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience \u2013 using a single PowerPoint slide. In this workshop we watch videos of 3MT winners (and losers) and you get to work on your own pitch. At the end of this workshop you will have the outline of an elevator speech and, probably, greater clarity on your thesis too.</SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P>This sessions is faciliteted by Associate Professor Inger Mewburn, aka the\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://thesiswhisperer.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Thesis Whisperer</A>, an expert in research communication.\u00a0Find out more about 3MT\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://www.anu.edu.au/research/skills-training/get-involved/three-minute-thesis-3mt\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A>.</P>\n<P><STRONG>100% of participants surveyed in 2017 recommend this presentation to their peers.
