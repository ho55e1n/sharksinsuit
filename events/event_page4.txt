                "text": "Bullet Proof Your Wealth\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think about money? Do you have enough of it? Want more? Do you regard money as a 'dirty word' or something that reflects the value provided to employers or customers?\nIt may be of interest to know that our attitude towards money affects how we live our personal lives. It may also play out in the salary we seek as well as how financially successful our businesses will be. Our attitude towards money may even play out in how we invest our idle funds, and ultimately, the success we have in growing our passive revenue streams.\u00a0\nWhat You Will Learn\nIn this two-hour workshop, you will learn\n\nThe psychological meaning of money;\nTypical attitudes to money;\nHow money attitudes are formed;\nHow deeply attitudes to money are formed;\nHow our money attitudes play out in our personal and professional lives;\u00a0\nIdentifying your own money attitudes; and\nHow to tweak your attitudes around money to meet more more of your financial goals, personally and professionally.\n\nDoors open at 5.15 p.m. for a 5.30 p.m. start.\nA range of teas and coffee are provided.\u00a0\nWho Should Attend?\nAll welcome.\nAbout the Presenter\nHi, I believe that everyone is entitled to be the best version of themselves across the lifespan and in each domain of their lives. Over the years, this belief has morphed into my higher order mission of helping people reach their full potential: Personally, professionally, entrepreneurially and money-wise. It has also shaped how I apply my knowledge, skills and abilities accumulated over 25 years of private practice.\u00a0This workshop is part of that.\nI draw on neuroscience, the power of the subconscious mind, healthy aging, logotherapy and goal-setting theories to help people reach more of their own full potential. And, while I have a professional interest in each of these areas, it is something I have been drawn to since I was about 14 or 15 years old. Indeed, some of the earliest books I bought (and still own) represent early thinking on the power of the subconscious mind.\nI am Doctor Rachel Abramson. I am an organisational, health and counselling psychoogist, with a PhD in behavioural finance (AKA economic psychology). I am also a hypnotherapist, career counsellor, trainer and educator. I am currently in the process of writing books in the same areas that I teach.\u00a0\nYou can learn more from me by subscribing to one or more of my four complimentary newsletters. Each newsletter aligns with one area of my higher order mission. You can also follow me on Facebook or Twitter or visit my website at http://www.rachel-abramson-and-associates.com.au. My website includes five\u00a0blogs\u00a0(two of which address the fourth area of my higher order mission).\u00a0\nYou may also find the following three videos informative. Here are the links:\nFirst interview: Selling on Value https://youtu.be/Fpk4dPi9vH4 \nSecond interview: Is Money Root of all Evil? https://youtu.be/6lFW9Q-DwAs\nThird interview: How to Charge What You Are Worth\u00a0https://youtu.be/e7rgehYQ3DQ\nFAQs\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYou will need to bring your printed ticket, a pen and notepad. We will supply tea and coffee as well as any other resources and handouts that you may need.\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes, you will need to bring your printed ticket or photo ID to the first seminar. It will facilitate the registration process.\nIs my ticket transferrable?\nYes, certainly. You will need to provide the transferee your printed ticket. They will need your ticket to register on the first day. You will also need to email rachela@ozemail.com.au to advise of the change of registrant details.\nHow do I get there if I am coming by public transport?\nLook for tramstop 26, near the corner of Beatrice street or Moubray street, depending on whether you are heading towards or away from the CBD.\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEnquiries can be directed to Dr. Abramson at rachela@ozemail.com.au or 0418 149 506 during normal business hours.\nCan I claim CPD hours?\nRegistered psychologists can claim up to two hours of 'active' CPD. A certificate of attendance will be provided upon request.",

Our classes aim to provide expectant parents with the knowledge and confidence to successfully breastfeed. The classes run by The Women's at Sandringham, are designed to help prepare expectant parents for the days, weeks and months after your baby's birth. We address breastfeeding from the very first breastfeed, through to maintaining your supply for your growing baby.\r\nClasses are run by our registered midwives, and are designed to compliment those attending the HypnoBirthing workshops.
