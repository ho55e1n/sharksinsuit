                "text": "Become a Certified Practitioner of the Luscher 8-Color-Test\r\nOur primal physiological responses to colours which appear in our natural environment are the premise of Dr. Luschers work.\u00a0Dr L\u00fcscher believed that sensory perception of colour is objective and universally shared by all, but that colour preferences are subjective, and this distinction allows subjective states to be objectively measured thus giving a 90% accurate reading of the client's current emotional disposition. The work of Ian Scott is based on the original works of Dr L\u00fcscher.\r\nThe Luscher-Color-Diagnostic\u00ae is a psychological profiling tool developed by Dr. Max Luscher in Basel, Switzerland.\u00a0 Dr. Luscher's research indicated that the colour selections are guided in an unconscious manner, they reveal the person as they really are, not as the perceive themselves, or how they would like to be perceived.\r\nThe results of the\u00a08-Color-Test\u00a0contain indications pertaining to personal assessment and special, professional recommendations as to how psychological stress and the resulting symptoms can be avoided. Dr L\u00fcscher said \u201cIan Scott\u00a0brings to the Color Test an initiative and an insight which I have not before encountered.\u201d\r\nThe test covers eight diagnostic colours and their meaning to give a 90% accurate readout of the client\u2019s current disposition. Using the\u00a08-Color-Test\u00a0to identify clients with severe clinical and psychological problems; the method allows a rapid and deep personality analysis from the colour ranking information.\r\nAs a Health Practitioner you will be able to identify those hidden thoughts and emotions in your patients which can sabotage your client's therapeutic progress.\r\nWhat the\u00a08-Color-Test\u00a0and therapy can do...\r\n\r\nThe test report will provide the practitioner with information from the patient\u2019s background.\r\nIt provides objectivity: no subjective factors either when administering the test or during its diagnostic evaluation.\r\nIt will differentiate between underlying constitution and momentary disposition.\r\nThe test methodology calls upon a non-verbal (subconscious) method.\r\nThe report will give direct and differentiated insight into the causes and psycho-vegetative structure of symptoms or complaints.\r\nThe test report will provide \u201cstructural therapeutic strategy\u201d for psychotherapy.\r\nAs well as suggestions for personal assessment.\r\n\r\nAbout the Course...\r\nThis one-day-intensive training program will provide an insight into using colours to confidently identify areas of conflict within the client.\r\nThe training will teach participants how to administer the\u00a08-Color-Test\u00a0and read the meanings of the eight colours. Upon graduation participants will be confident in reading the\u00a08-Color-Test\u00a0to give a 90% accurate readout of the client\u2019s current disposition.\r\nNo knowledge of the assessment tool is required to begin with. An explanation of the history, plus the steps in using this method with a client will be demonstrated.

                "text": "Course Description:\u00a0Power BI is the newest Microsoft Business Intelligence and Data Analysis tool.\u00a0In this module we will go through basics of this product, and introduce all five components of Power BI (Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, Power Map, and Power Q&A).\nYou will see some demos and introduction about Power BI desktop, Office 365 Power BI subscription, and Power BI website, and mobile apps. You will see some basic demos of how easy to use is Power BI in some scenarios.\nModule 1: Introduction to Power BI\nPower BI is the newest Microsoft Business Intelligence and Data Analysis tool. In this module we will go through basics of this product, and introduce all five components of Power BI (Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, Power Map, and Power Q&A). You will see some demos and introduction about Power BI desktop, Office 365 Power BI subscription, and Power BI website, and mobile apps. You will see some basic demos of how easy to use is Power BI in some scenarios.\nModule 2: Getting Data\nGetting Data is the first experience of working with Power BI. You can connect to many data sources on-premises or on cloud. For some data sources you can have a live or direct connection, for some connection works offline. For some connections you need a gateway or connector to be installed. In this module you will learn everything about get data experience of Power BI.\nModule 3: Power Query for Data Transformation\nData analysis and BI world starts from data extraction and transformation. Power Query is the data transformation engine of Power BI. Power Query comes as part of Excel 2016, or as an add-in for Excel 2013 and 2010. Power Query is also part of Power BI Desktop. In this module you will learn about all different version of Power Query, their similarities, and differences, as well as configuration and requirements of using them.Power Query uses a graphical user interface to apply transformations on the dataset. However Power Query works with a functional scripting language behind the scenes. The key to learn Power Query is learning the functional language called M. There are many features in M that are not available in the Power Query GUI. In this module you will learn how to understand M, and how to write M scripts even from scratch. You will learn writing custom functions in M as well as many other useful features.\nModule 4: Power Pivot for Data Modelling\nPower Pivot is xVelocity in-memory data modelling engine of the Power BI. Modelling effectively is the key of high performance BI solution. In this module you will learn basics of Power Pivot such as creating relationships, and calculated members, as well as advanced best practices and DAX expressions. DAX is Data Analytical eXpression language. DAX has similar structure to excel functions, but it is different. In this module you will learn DAX from beginner to advance. You will learn basic functions as well as complex functions and scenarios of using them in real world challenges.\nModule 5: Data Visualidation with Power BI Desktop, Power View and Power Map\nData Visualization is the front end of any BI application, this is the user view point of your system. It is critical to visualize measures, and dimensions effectively so the BI system could tell the story of the data clearly. In this module you will learn conceptual best practices of data visualizations which is valid through all data visualization tools. You will learn Power View and Power Map skills. Power View is the interactive data visualization tool and Power Map is 3D geo-spatial data visualization tool. You will learn how to create effective charts, and dashboards using these tools as well as best practices for working with these tools. There are two version of Power View; Power View for Excel, and Power View for SharePoint which will be covered in this module as well.\nModule 6: Designing the best solution with Power Q&A\nPower BI introduced a new engine for users which focus on users who wants to play with the data more, and understand the story behind the data better. Power Q&A is question and answering engine which works based on human natural language. Power Q&A automatically will be enabled on Power BI files deployed into Power BI website, or Office 365 subscription. However there are some tips and tricks about how to design your model to get the best type of answers through Power Q&A. In this module you will learn best practices for modelling that effect on the response of Power Q&A.\nModule 7: Power BI Desktop; combination of three tools\nPower BI Desktop (Previously was known as Power BI Designer) is the new designer tool that enhance combination of three main Power BI components; Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View. Power BI Desktop has great features that will be fully explored in this module. There is slightly difference from components of Power BI desktop with their original versions; in this module you will learn these differences. You will learn how to use Power BI desktop to mash up data, model it, and visualize it. Best practices of design will be all discussed with demos.\nModule 8: Administration\nPower BI components can be deployed into different environments such as Power BI website, Office 365 subscription, or even SharePoint on-premises. In this module we will go through deployment options, Configurations and requirements required for each environment. You will learn how to deploy your Power BI files into Power BI website. you will also learn how to build dashboards in the website, and how to work with Mobile Apps for Apple, Android and Windows Phone.\n\n\u00a0Understand primary features of a self-service Power BI solution\nUtilize Power BI and its data sources\nCombine, analyze, model, shape, and visualize data\nReport data using rich dashboards\n\nOnce after the training you receive course completion certificate from Mangates",
