The conversation will attempt to find ways of creatively describing what we hear. The intention is to enhance our understanding of listening by making ourselves more conscious of how we process this through language \u2014 learning how to listen to our listening. The interviews will be recorded and a poetic condensation of each exchange*, which will be included in an evolving archive \u2014\u00a0an interactive e-publication\u00a0\u2014 that explores multiple aspects of this proposed language of listening.\n*Participants will be consulted on the final version of their entry in the e-publication.\n\n--------\nGail Priest is a Sydney-based artist whose practice features sound as the key material of communication and investigation. She has exhibited sound installations and performed electro-acoustic compositions nationally and internationally including at ISEA2016, Hong Kong; Werkleitz Festival, Germany; the Sonoretum, Kapelica Gallery, Slovenia; Tokyo Wonder Site, Japan; Artspace, Sydney; and Performance Space, Sydney. She has undertaken several commissions for ABC Radio and released five albums. She is also a curator of concerts and exhibitions, and writes factually and fictively about sound and media arts, in particular for\u00a0RealTimemagazine.\nIn 2015-2016 Priest was the Australia Council Emerging and Experimental Arts Fellow, developing a body of ficto-critical work exploring what art will sound like in the future. Her upcoming projects explore an \u2018ideasthesia\u2019 of sound and text by developing a hybrid form of \u2018sound-writing\u2019.\nwww.gailpriest.net\n\nFind out more about this artwork, showing as part of Experimenta Make Sense: International Triennial of Media Art, 6 April \u2013 30 June 2019, Latrobe Regional Gallery (Morwell, VIC) www.experimenta.org/makesense\n\n\nPlease note that your email address will only ever be used to communicate with you regarding Experimenta event evaluation.

                "text": "Contrary to the significant swing in public opinion against fur in fashion in the 1990\u2019s, today there are more designers using fur than ever before, with approximately 500 fashion designers using fur in their ready-to-wear fashion lines. The global fur industry is now worth over $40 billion US dollars, and the global leather industry is even larger, valued at over $200 billion US dollars. In light of the significant welfare issues raised by fur production, numerous high-end fashion designers have gone fur-free, including Calvin Klein and Giorgio Armani. Various jurisdictions around the world have also banned the production, importation and sale of fur. In contrast, the leather industry hasn\u2019t faced the same reaction, although fur and leather alternatives are both increasing in popularity, with the synthetic leather market projected to reach $85 billion US dollars by 2025. Signalling change in the air, last month LA held the very first vegan fashion week, showcasing designs from a new generation of compassionate designers. Organic leather alternatives are also on the rise, including vegetable, pineapple, mushroom and even apple leather entering the market. All of these developments indicate that we are genuinely starting to take the first steps towards a cruelty-free fashion future. Come along to the presentation to discuss this important issue with Dr Meg Good, Animal Law & Education Manager at Voiceless.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDr Meg Good is the Animal Law and Education Manager at Voiceless, the animal protection institute. She holds a PhD in environmental law, and an appointment as an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of Tasmania where she runs the \u2018Animal Law\u2019 unit and supervises animal law honours theses. She has held positions with various animal law organisations, including the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, the Animal Law Institute, and the Australian Animal Protection Law Journal.

Theta brainwaves are present during REM dreaming sleep, deep meditation and hypnosis. These states are considered the gateway to the subconscious mind and it's here where we experience heightened creativity, depth of imagination and access to the subconscious realms where deep-seated healing can take place.\nSound healing facilitates shifts in our brainwave state to slow down, soothe and relax. It creates the perfect vibrational frequnecy for healing to occur -\u00a0bringing us back into harmony.\nWhether you are a beginner or have an already existing meditation practice, guided sound meditations can help you access those deeper states of relaxation and invoke a more profound connection between mind, body and soul.\nWhat to expect during a sound healing?\nRelax and fall deep into your own sonic universe. The singing bowl sound meditation will balance your Chakra energy centers, clear your mind, and gently release stuck emotions and blocked energy that no longer serves you.\nBy connecting with your inner harmony, you will find yourself in a place where you are able to powerfully resonate with all things you would like to call into your life. The biggest side effect to attending a sound bath is a night of extremely blissful sleep.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease contact Ashleigh Bell for further enquiries: 0421217872",
