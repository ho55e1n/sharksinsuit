The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is received or the crisis resolves. Mental health first aid strategies are taught in evidence-based training programs authored by Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)\u00a0Australia and conducted by accredited MHFA Instructors across Australia.\nThe Youth Mental Health First Aid Course is for adults working or living with adolescents (those aged between 12 and 18 years), however, the course can be relevant for those helping people who are a little younger or older.\u00a0This course is particularly suitable for parents, teachers, sports coaches, and youth workers.\n\nWhat the course covers:\nThe course teaches adults how to assist adolescents who are developing a mental health problem or in a mental health crisis. Course participants learn about adolescent development, the signs and symptoms of the common and disabling mental health problems in young people, where and how to get help when a young person is developing a mental illness, what sort of help has been shown by research to be effective, and how to provide first aid in a crisis situation.\u00a0 \n\nDeveloping mental health problems covered are:\n\u2022 Depression\n\u2022 Anxiety problems\n\u2022 Psychosis\n\u2022 Substance use problems\n\u2022 Eating disorders\n\nMental health crisis situations covered are:\n\u2022 Suicidal thoughts and behaviours\n\u2022 Non-suicidal self-injury (sometimes called deliberate self-harm)\n\u2022 Panic attacks\n\u2022 Traumatic events\n\u2022 Severe effects of drug or alcohol use\n\u2022 Severe psychotic states\n\u2022 Aggressive behaviours\n\nFormat\nThis is a 14 hour course, 2-day training package (7 hours per day)\nCourse participants receive a copy of the Youth MHFA Manual to keep and a Certificate of Completion.\nYouth MHFA Manual\nA manual is provided to each participant attending this 14-hour MHFA course.\nOn the day what do you need to bring?\nJust a pen and yourself.\nMorning tea , afternoon tea and lunch are provided.

An optional half-day introduction to Stata will also be provided on 3 June for those that have not used Stata before.\nCourse information\nThis 3-day training course is designed for people who are interested in using the HILDA Survey data but have not yet done so. It will take a descriptive research problem such as \u201cWhat happens to single mothers who receive Parenting Payment Single? Do they stay on the program from one year to the next? Do they move to another income support program? Do they leave income support?\u201d and go through all the steps necessary to answer questions such as these. We begin with the latest HILDA Release and assume participants have relatively little experience in working with large data sets. The training will then cover the following topics:\n\nAccessing the data\nFinding the right data\nVisualising the data\nMerging household and individual data\nDealing with missing values\nUsing imputed values\nCreating analysis variables from HILDA data\nApplying weights\nGenerating descriptive statistics in the panel context\nUnderstanding data patterns in the panel context\nAnswering the question\n\nThere will be scope within the course to deal with individual questions which participants might have about data extraction and structure in panel data contexts.\nCourse instructors\nThe course will be presented by Professor Robert Breunig and Nicole Watson.\nProfessor Robert Breunig is a member of the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University. His primary applied research interests are in analysing individual and firm behaviour, evaluating government tax and transfer programs and analysing large data sets.\nNicole Watson is part of the HILDA Survey team at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne. She has worked on the HILDA project since 2000 and has been involved in the sample design, weighting, imputation and survey management.\nPre-requisites\nYou do not need to have used the HILDA data or Stata before. You should have some experience with a statistical software package, such as SAS, SPSS or Stata. While the course will be taught in Stata, SAS equivalent code will be provided. You will need to apply for, and be approved to use, HILDA General Release 17.\nRegistrations\nPlaces are limited. Registrations close 5pm 23 May 2019 unless all of the places are taken earlier. Cancellations after 5pm 27 May 2019 will not be refunded. \nIf you would like to receive notifications of other training courses, please subscribe to the HILDA mailing list.\nCourse details\nLocation:\n198 Berkeley Street (The Spot), University of Melbourne (lab to be advised)\u00a0\nDate/time:\nTuesday 4 June to Thursday 6 June 2019, 9.15am \u2013 4pm\nplus optional: Monday 3 June \u2013 A short \u2018Introduction to Stata\u2019 for those who have little or no Stata experience, 1.30-4.30pm\nCatering:\nMorning tea, lunch and afternoon tea provided\nFees (incl.

Have melt downs over small things like noises and clothes tags? Have fussy eating patterns? Have trouble with sleep? Struggle with social skills? Have difficulties with coordination?

                "text": "Advancing Women\u2019s Leadership Program - 1 Day Seminar\nHi Marina, It was a privilege to work with you (and the great group of ladies)\u00a0and I took away some wonderful information and tools. Looking forward to getting some more of your wonderful coaching again in the near future.x (Brisbane 13 September)\nThis Advancing Women's Leadership Seminar will accelerate you to achieving your career and business goals by helping you to access and live your authentic purpose. Becoming clear about your values, goals and life direction are only the beginning steps to fulfilling your leadership and business potential. As women, we often self-sabotage our success by playing too small and not thinking big enough. If you have a big dream, then you will need a clear vision to help your manifest your leadership goals.\nThis 1-day seminar will provide you with the opportunity to set your leadership goals and metrics to achieve them.\nTopics include:\n\n\nIdentify your leadership skills and internal assets and maximise their potential by learning how to effectively set goals.\n\n\nLearn the power of influence by projecting a professional leadership style.\n\n\nIdentify your success blockers and self-sabotaging behaviours that prevent you from achieving your business and or leadership goals.\n\n\nIdentify your limiting belief program structure and then strategise how to eliminate it for good.\n\n\nPower of words - assertive communication and presentation strategies to strengthen your presence and impact.\n\n\nMaximise your impact and get 'unstuck' by overcoming self-doubt and comparing yourself to others.\n\n\nLearn Resilience strategies to help you bounce back during setbacks as you move towards your goals.\n\n\nIncrease your Emotional Intelligence and learn strategies to improve your self-confidence and personal brand.\n\n\nWhat People Are Saying - Testimonials\nThe atmosphere was very warm, collaborative and full of feminine strength. Very uplifting and the questionnaires for self-evaluation were very helpful. The course was covered at a good pace. (Norma- Melbourne 2017)\nThe small group was an excellent way to learn and to connect with the other women. This program delivered above what I was expecting. I really enjoyed every session. I am not good at sticking to something but I wouldn\u2019t have missed a session. (Marie \u2013 Melbourne 2017)\nMarina is very clear and positive in her communication and she creates a calm environment. She is very engaging. This course has given me a lot to think about and learning about conflict management styles and how to develop my presentation skills really helped increase my level of self-awareness. (Vanessa- Melbourne 2017)\nThis Leadership program delivered above what I thought it would. It has really helped me develop assertive communication skills, dealing with conflict, and my ability to speak in front of an audience. It was great.\u00a0(Zoe \u2013 Melbourne 2017)\nThe Assertiveness Skills and Conflict Management Workshop was just excellent. I learned how to analyse the situation, emotions, conflicting styles and tools to help prevent conflict from escalating. Keep going, excellent \u2013 thank you very much.
