This workshop is designed specifically for candidates who are considering doing\u00a0the Three Minute Thesis or just to help you make more impactful conference presentations. \nThis workshop will be presented by Associate Professor Inger Mewburn, Director of Research Training, ANU (aka the Thesis Whisperer). Please bring with you paper and pens.\u00a0\n100% of participants survyed in 2018 would recommend this presentation to their peers. Participants said:\n\"The workshop was very informative and encouraged us to think outside of the comfort zone of the data and details of our PhD. The workshop taught many skills that I will use in the future to showcase my PhD at conferences and around the school/university.\"\n\"It's a great way to get a handle on messaging your research.\"\nStrictly limited places.Click\u00a0here\u00a0for a map to this session\u2019s location.If you have any questions, please contact the\u00a0ANU Research Skills and Training team on\u00a0researchtraining@anu.edu.au\nBy registering for this event, you are committing to attendance.

For instructions,\u00a0click here.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Python for Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nPython is a high level and general purpose programming language. Millions of Python users contribute to a thriving open-source community that also enjoys immense commercial use and support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA core set of packages and interfaces (Juptyer Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn) presents analysts and data scientists with an interactive and powerful tool to perform data mining, statistical analysis and visualisation.\u00a0\nData-science teams usually use at least one of Python and R in their production environments or analysis pipelines. Python is also the tool of choice of elite data-mining competition winners and deep-learning innovations such as Tensorflow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people. Select your desired quantity of tickets and click \u201cAdd to cart\u201d to see the discount calculated before checkout.\nPlease contact us at enquiries@presciient.com to find out more about these special rates.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nThis two-day course is an introduction to Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks, beginning with the most basic operations of downloading and installing the Python environment. The course will use Anaconda, a popular Python distribution for data science that includes many of the packages used in this course.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThe course will also introduce core Python objects and operations, Numpy for statistical and matrix operations, matplotlib and Plotly for visualisations, and Pandas, a comprehensive data manipulation and analysis package.\u00a0\u00a0\nParticipants will learn how to input, read, write, and manipulate data, primarily using Pandas, and be instructed in all the aspects of procedural programming in Python, allowing them to create their own Python modules.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJupyter Notebooks will be featured as the recommended interface to write code, explore and analyse data, and to document and communicate the results of the data analysis with interactive visualisations.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe course is focused on providing a foundation for participants to use Python for exploratory data analysis and visualisation, which can be used as a stepping stone to machine learning using the popular scikit-learn package and deep-learning packages unique to Python. Familiarity with Python will allow users to use packages and access data and web services that have existing connections to Python, e.g. natural language processing, APIs, and web scraping.\n\n\nWho should attend?\nThis is a practical course, suitable for existing and prospective data-analysis practitioners in government and industry. Participants will be provided with a range of programmatic and user-interface options for working with data in Python. The course assumes no specialised statistical knowledge. Its focus is developing a practical understanding of Python as a tool for business users.\n\nCourse Outcomes\nAttendees will, by the end of the course, have the basic skills, resources, guidance and confidence to immediately and self-sufficiently begin to use Python in their work.\n\nCourse instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request. With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging.\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services\n\nPrerequisites\nThe course assumes no tertiary level training in statistics. Attendees simply need to be familiar with working with structured, electronic data.\n\nPlatform\nThe course will make use of the Anaconda Distribution of Python and some of the training may be demonstrated using Microsoft Azure Notebooks or on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine.\n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course. Please notify us at least a week ahead if you have any special dietary requirements.\n\nFeedback\nUse enquiries@presciient.com to email us any questions about the course, including requests for more detail, or for specific content you would like to see covered, or queries regarding prerequisites and suitability.\nIf you would like to attend but for any reason cannot, please also let us know.\n\nVariation\nCourse material may vary from advertised due to demands and learning pace of attendees. Additional material may be presented, along with or in place of advertised.\n\nCancellation and refunds\nYou can get a full refund if you cancel 2 weeks or more before the course starts. No refunds will be issued for cancellations made less than 2 weeks before the course starts.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\nDo I need to bring my own computer?\nThere\u2019s no need to bring your own laptop or PC.\u00a0Our courses take place in modern, professional training facilities that have all the computing equipment you\u2019ll need.\nI'm lost!

A way of training the eye, brain and hand to work as one. Like scales for a musician or knife skills for a chef, life drawing helps align, tune and focus the visual artist.
