                "text": "\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE COURSE:\nThis course has as primary objective to certify professionals in the international methodology named PMO VALUE RING, which can be used to create, evaluate and restructure PMOs, focusing on value generation.\nThe PMO-CP certificate is issued by the PMO Global Alliance. PMO Solutions\u00a0is the prime partner of PMO Global Alliance in Australia to deliver this training in Australia.\nThe PMO-CP certified professional can demonstrate alignment with the most important methodology in the world for strategic management of PMOs, based on best practices and international research.\n\nABOUT THE PMO VALUE RING METHODOLOGY:\nThe PMO VALUE RING methodology is now used by professionals in more than 65 countries. There are hundreds of PMO-CPs in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.\nThe methodology is supported by a database with the collective intelligence of a worldwide community of PMO leaders, from which recommendations are obtained on best practices and solutions to the challenges of PMOs.\nMore information about the methodology can be found at www.pmovaluering.com.\n\nABOUT THE PMO-CP EXAM:\nTo obtain the certification, the candidate must be approved on an online proctored exam of 40 multiple choice questions, achieving a minimum score of 75%.\nThe exam covers technical aspects related to the methodology, and the candidate has up to 60 minutes to finish it.\nThe online exam is proctored, like some of the most recognized certifications in the world. It means that the candidate will be able to take the online exam in the most appropriate place and will be monitored throughout the exam by one of our monitors.\nThe proctored exam can only be scheduled after the completion of the face to face training The candidate will have up to 15 days to schedule the exam. If he/she miss it, it is possible to have an extra period of 15 days at an additional cost of US $ 50.00.\nThe exam must be scheduled at least 72 hours in advance of the desired / available day and time.\nIf the candidate fails in the first attempt, it is possible to make a second attempt at the additional cost of US $ 100.00. This amount should be paid within 10 working days and, after 5 working days, the candidate will have 15 days to schedule and make the second attempt.\nDetailed instructions about this process will be available to the candidates after registration.\nPMO Global Alliance provides only a digital PMO-CP certificate. It will be sent to the email previously informed by the candidate within 7 days after passing the exam.\n\nABOUT THE PMO VALUE RING SOFTWARE:\nYou can create your free account at www.pmovaluering.com. This account will give you access to all methodology features with some commercial restrictions.\nIf you want to learn more about PMO Value ring types of licenses, please keep in contact.\nThe concepts of the PMO VALUE RING methodology are useful, regardless of the use of the software that supports it.\nThe great advantage of using the PMOVR software is that it gives access to a benchmarking database with the collective intelligence of the PMO leaders community, allowing the user to get recommendations on which paths to take in PMO design.\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR:\nAmireh Amirmazaheri\nAmireh is a PMO and business analyst professional with over 17 years\u2019 industry experience. She holds a Master of Information Technology from Macquarie University and is certified in PMI-PBA, PRINCE2 and P3O.

Join us for the\u00a0warmest\u00a0\u00a0introduction to\u00a0meditation this Winter!\nWhat to expect:\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Light stretching to still the body\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sound Mediation to still the mind\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Play! Fluffy cuddles from a furry friend\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait, but why are we meditating with this much cuteness? \u00a0Won\u2019t I be even MORE distracted?\nThe short answer is yes. The long answer is that Breathe In & Bleat Out is a metaphor for what meditating actually feels like when you first start. Your first meditation sitting isn\u2019t going to be perfect, and it certainly won\u2019t be still. You\u2019ll have thoughts, feelings, memories and dreams niggling at you, gnawing on you and clamouring for attention.\nJust like our furry friends. \n\nThese cuties nibble, nuzzle, dribble and piddle, but I can promise you won\u2019t get worked up over it. In fact, I can guarantee you\u2019ll leave with nothing but a smile! And maybe a few selfies (Good luck trying to get a baby goat to pose!) Instead of criticising yourself for being unable to sit still in perfect, spiritual silence, you\u2019ll learn to compassionately observe this chaos, embrace the moment and stop kicking yourself for not being so damn perfect all the time.\nWhy we chose baby goats:\n1) Fewer allergies than cats & dogs\n2) Cuddling causes warm fuzzy feelings in humans and animals! Whether from our human friends or furry ones, cuddling is proven to release oxytocin, which boosts the immune system, reduces stress and relieves pain! \u201cOxytocin is a natural stress reliever\u2026 it acts on our brain to diminish anxiety and induce relaxation\u201d - Harvard Health Letter.\n3) Researchers in the UK have found evidence that goats are just as clever as dogs, and build complex emotional relationships with humans!\n4) Stanford PAWS program has been using animal therapy for 20 years to raise the spirits of hospitalised patients.

The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox\u00a03 to 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nComplimentary handout material \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

This is a deep dive into the role based on the internationally recognised Scrum Guide and the learning objectives of the Scrum Alliance.\nThis course is designed to be highly practical in its focus and format. It offers a unique opportunity to gain knowledge and experience at an accelerated rate. By exploring real world case studies and effectively applied real world solutions the trainee gains insight that might otherwise take years to achieve.\nThere is also a clear focus on an approach using the lens of a Product Owner to all aspects of Scrum.

Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\r\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions, for expectant mothers and fathers and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and best for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\r\nOur courses are designed for expectant and new parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant or early after the birth. These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\r\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\r\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\r\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\r\nRegistration and membership includes:\r\n\r\nApprox 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments\u00a0\r\nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book\u00a0Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\r\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\r\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\"\u00a0\r\nComplimentary handout material\u00a0\r\n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Although breastfeeding is natural and best for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN>Our courses are designed for expectant and new parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant or early after the birth. These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><STRONG><SPAN>My baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!</SPAN></STRONG></P>\r\n<P><SPAN>Please book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>PLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\r\n<P><SPAN>Registration and membership includes:</SPAN></P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Approx 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments\u00a0</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>One-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book<EM>\u00a0Breastfeeding ... naturally</EM>, valued at $35.00</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Introduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>One year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\"\u00a0</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>Complimentary handout material\u00a0</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN>50% discount on breast pump hire rates</SPAN></LI>\r\n</UL>\r\n<P>\u00a0</P>\r\n<P>\u00a0</P>\r\n<P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>\r\n<P>\u00a0</P>\r\n<P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>\r\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><BR></SPAN></STRONG></P>\r\n<P><SPAN><SPAN><STRONG><BR></STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P>"
