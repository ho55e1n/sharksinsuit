The opportunity as a woman to grow in public speaking skill and settle with ease into doing so is made so much more of a comfortable exercise between peers for the express reason that it is carried out in front of a community of women. Women have also developed the training.\n As a speaker and workshop facilitator I recognise the worth inherent in this offering. I feel this is an exciting time as the feminine presence is being recognised for the strength and relevance apparent.\n SHE Public Speaker Training Platform gives me much faith in the future of speaker training and for the development of careers for women speakers.\u201d ~ Eva Sifis Project Officer, Trainer with Women with Disabilities Vic and Arts Access Vic / Director of By Accident.\n\nMore information & Inquiries \nCALL Fur Wale\n0406-417-463\n\nSHE Talks\u00ae The Voice Of Experience!\n'Credibly - Authentically - Expertly'\nSPEAK.

As alcohol is at the event, you must be over 18 to attend. Please bring a valid form of identification with you on the day just to be sure (Passport or driving license).\nAre children permitted at the event?\nThis is always a tough one. Whilst the answer is a non discriminatory \u2018yes\u2019, our events are often very busy, loud and a little hectic so not an ideal place for little people. We suggest getting a baby sitter and having the day off. We\u2019ll bring the wine.\nWill tickets be available on the door?\nOnly if there are any available. But more often than not, \u2018no\u2019 as the events sell out prior. We cap numbers to ensure everyone has a great time and it\u2019s not too crazy as we want you coming back. We strongly suggest buying tickets prior to ensure you don\u2019t miss out.\nIs there a refund policy?\nRefunds are available on all tickets up to 30 days prior to the event. After that date, no dice. If after that time, it\u2019s always good to check on the event facebook pages as often people are looking to purchase ones if the event is sold out.\nI haven\u2019t received my ticket? What do I do?\nAn automated email is sent upon purchasing tickets. If you don\u2019t receive it, it could be for a couple of reasons. Firstly, check the spam folder as sometimes they get stuck there. Other times, when in a rush to purchase (!), some accidentally enter their email address incorrectly. If that\u2019s the case, drop us an email and we\u2019ll search and resend. But all good, you\u2019ll be in our system.\nDo I need to print the tickets.\nIt\u2019s always easier, yes. But, even better is the eventbrite app which keeps them all on your phone. We\u2019ll scan you in when you arrive.\nTasting, not drinking!\nWe like to think of these events as a tasting, not a drinking as we want you to experience as many different wine styles on offer. Creating a safe, welcoming and non-intimidating event environment is what we\u2019re all about so any inappropriate behaviour, of an intoxicated nature or not, that is dangerous to yourself and or others, is just not acceptable.\nWe have a strict\u00a0\u2018no tolerance' policy so if we witness any of the above, we reserve the right to take appropriate action and have you removed from the venue.\nI\u2019ve got a couple of other random questions, what should I do?\nEasy.

Are you ready to listen?\u00a0\n\nWhat to Expect \u2026\nAmelia begins the session by explaining what to expect and how everything will work for the afternoon. She\u2019ll start with teaching the audience a quick way to align with source, go through a \u201cSoul Fragment Retrieval\u201d exercise and she\u2019ll conduct a \u201cDNA Activation\u201d while the audience meditates to some beautiful medicine music. This is the first half an hour or so.\nOnce the audience is energetically ready to receive, Amelia will jump right in and commence the audience readings. An audience member is chosen to go up on stage with Amelia and share their question / fear, in which Amelia will Channel Messages to answer. \nNot every member of the audience will be chosen for a read however, every audience member will benefit on more than an energetic level.

This is were Amelia helps \u2026 She will channel messages from various sources and say the right thing at the right time, every time.\nAmelia channels 3 different higher realm energies \u2026 \u201cThe Council\u201d of the Light (think 12 different beings of all colours, shapes, sizes and races), \u201cThe Scholars\u201d (think Gregorian Chant) and \u201cThe Z\u2019s\u201d (think Lee Harris, just different ones). Amelia has 3 Guides she works with \u2026 Running with Wolves (A native American Indian Sharman Leader who was her \u201cFather\u201d in another life), Angelo the Wolf and Archangel Raphael. Each of her guides help in different ways and serve different purposes. As well as all this, Amelia can see Spirits not just of this life but that of others. She can tell you which life, the year and describe so many details, it can get overwhelming at times. \n\n\u00a0Approx.
