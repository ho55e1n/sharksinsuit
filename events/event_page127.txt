The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \nComplimentary handout material \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

We have no leaders in this race to advise us of what the best option is moving forward, nor do we have a 'how to manual' on navigating these tender years.\nIt is therefore up to us to come together and work it out!\nExactly how are we going to get our teens to their twenties in one piece, free of online bullying and mental health issues, suicide, pressure from social media, the pressure to be switched on and productive 24/7, the pressure to be a success before they even finish high school?\nWell, in line with raising my hand and saying I do not have it all worked out. I will be the first to say I am working it out, I am working through some of the above issues on a daily basis. I have had to deal with most of these issues and then some over the last 2+ years.\nWhilst trying to navigate this oh so delicate period of my teens life, I realised there was no resource out there with all of the answers, there was no one I could turn to who could advise me of what to do when facing the challenges of online bullying, bouts of depression, managing the hormonal fluctuations, teen dating, children caught in the middle of a marriage breakdown. I had no one to turn to, yes there is support out there in terms of counselling and mental health resources. This however was not my challenge, my challenge was in the day to day parenting, managing all of the above on a daily basis, learning to deal with a teenager in my home, the sudden and dramatic change from my baby to this grown teen who was struggling to cope in this digital world, where suddenly the expectations placed on them had their whole world turned upside down. They go from being our babies, protected and sheltered from the world in primary school to being thrown out into this world where they are suddenly expected to cope and perform as adults, essentially overnight their world is huge and overwhelming. As much as we prepare them for young adulthood, they are still very much ill-equipped to deal with the challenges they encounter. On one hand they thrive with the newfound freedom and responsibility, yet on the other they are still these babies in almost grown bodies struggling to live up to the expectations placed on them by us, society, school and their peers.\nSo how do we support them, how do we maintain our sanity whilst guiding them and how do we maintain peace in our homes and lives?\nJoin me to learn some of the tools we are using in our home to navigate these tender years. This time with them is going to form the foundation of your future relationship with your young adults.\nIt is so important to get it right now, there is no time to waste, there is no waiting until tomorrow.\nI cannot promise that you will have perfect bliss each and every day hereafter, that is unrealistic but what I can promise you is that you will develop a beautiful connection and bond with your child that will see you through these teenage years. You will have a foundation built upon love, respect, honesty and trust. From this starting point there is nothing you cannot work through.\nThis workshop is practical and hands on, it is tailored and designed for you to attend with your teens, ages 12+. Parents with younger children are encouraged to attend as these tools are practical and form the foundation for parenting across the board (children below the age of 12 will not be able to attend unfortunately, some content is not suitable).\nI look forward to sharing with you the ideas and tools that have not only kept my teen safe but saved our relationship and brought about a sense of peace and joy in our home and lives. This is no quick fix, it will take your commitment and dedication. If you are not willing to do the hard work in terms of parenting, then this is not the workshop for you. Improving your relationship with your teen will take time and energy, just as every other relationship in your life does. So, if you are ready and prepared to throw out the rule book in terms of parenting and embrace some new ideas, this is where you need to be.\nI look forward to sharing part of my journey, successes and learnings with you. My son has worked alongside me putting this workshop together and will be there with us on the day to share some insights through the eyes of a teen.\nPlease share this with your friends and family who may benefit from this workshop.\nFeel free to reach out via Email or Direct Message, should you require any further information at all or wish to discuss your situation with me prior to making a decision about attending the day.\nI look to the past in the hopes of creating a space where we can come together as a community and support each other to raise the brilliant young men and women of the future.\n\u201cIT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD\u201d\nLove and Light\nBx\nFor further information, please email me at bianca@blurayne.org",

                "text": "GIRL POWER provides fun, interactive well-being workshops for girls aged 7 - 12 yrs.\nOur mission is to foster a positive mindset, inner confidence and resilience in girls at a young age, before they embark on their teenage years and exposed to the powerful world of social media. Our workshops are based on positive psychology principles and delivered by way of fun, creative and engaging activities. Girls come away from our workshops knowing themselves better, understanding the power they have over their own lives and with increased social awareness.\nThis workshop is 5.5 hrs and covers the following topics:\nMe, Myself and I\u00a0- Identity, Individuality, Strengths\nHey You!\u00a0- Healthy Friendships, Friendship Issues, Dealing with Mean Behaviour\nI Can Do It!\u00a0- Growth Mindset,\u00a0Resilience\nRelax - Mindfulness, Staying Calm\nMirror Mirror - Body Image\nLucky Me\u00a0- Gratitude\nThe girls explore these topics by way of movement, worksheets, vibrant discussion, active games with props, role play and art/craft.\u00a0\nAt Girl Power we\u00a0believe it is paramount that girls focus on their strengths, rather than weaknesses and intentionally create experiences that result in a positive mindset and inner confidence.\nSome comments from parents of past GIRL POWER workshop participants...\n\"When my daughter came home Thursday night after your session, she was so proud of her Girl Power pack, what she had written and what others had affirmed. I saw after a very long year of tears and temper a glimmer of self-esteem and confidence I have not seen in such a long time. Thank you!!!!\u201d Victoria (parent of school workshop participant)\n\"I was so impressed with how the workshop ran. The activities were all great fun with a positive and empowering message underlying each of them. The girls finished the day with tools to help them think more positively about themselves and how they handle the inevitable difficulties they face in social situations. Fabulous. I highly recommend Girl Power workshops!\"\u00a0Natushka, mother of Josie (9)\n\"My daughter was excited about coming to the workshop. She enjoyed it and told me all the things she did. She really had a great time. And this makes me happy\u201d Daniela, mother of Miss 7\n\"I like everything that Girl Power is about! All of the topics are great and she enjoyed the first 2 hours so much, she is doing the 5 week program\u201d Julie, mother of Beth (10)\n\"My daughter and her friend had such a wonderful time today Joni. They were busy talking about their favourite parts (all of it) and it's been wonderful to see them put into practice some of the things they learnt such as their gratitude box. Wish there had been workshops like this for me when I was young. Thanks for this\"\u00a0Jess, mother of Matilda (11)\n\"A fabulous workshop for young ladies to encourage positive mind set, supportive behaviours and self value\u201d\u00a0Debbie, Primary School Teacher\n\u201cLily loved it! She was excited to share what she learned with us. Also, the \"smiley\" vs \"frownie\" technique has already been applied at home. Thanks!\u201d\u00a0Anne-Marie, mother of Lily (7)\n\"Thank you so much for a wonderful workshop. Lola had a wonderful time.

If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nComplimentary handout material \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

This workshop, presented by Andria Kliszewski and Susan Douglass, will focus on the benefits of Transformational Yoga and deepening your own practice. This event is open to all Yoga teachers, members and non-members alike. \n\nWhat's on the agenda?\nWe all know the benefits of the asana practice in yoga. We have learnt them, we have felt them and we teach them. During this process, there is a moment where we start to move deeper.\nSomething inspires us to learn more and move out of the physical practice and we start exploring our own inner journey. This at times can be confusing and sometimes depending on our physical practice we can feel stuck. In all yoga journeys if you continue there is a moment you need to go deeper.\nThe Transformational Yoga Practice in its original authentic origins will allow the depth of the practice to unveil itself. We are met with our own limitations and the blocks can be removed one step at a time.\nCome and experience this truly authentic practice that has derived from the ancient Indian practice of yoga where Swami Vidyanand has prepared tools you need in order to make a difference in your everyday life. In-depth focus of asanas, chakras, mantras, breathing and meditation techniques giving you the knowledge you need to purify your body, stabilise your emotions, focus your mind and increase your spiritual well-being. Transformational Yoga is specifically to deepen your own practice and we caution using any of the practice in classes without prior training. \n\nAbout the Presenters - Andria Kliszewski and Susan Douglass\nAndria\u00a0Kliszewski\u00a0\nAndria is the Director of the Vidyanand Transformational Yoga Australia.

She has recently returned from a trip to India where she spent time learning ancient yogic wisdom with Swamiji Vidyanand and was honoured with her Grandmasters in yoga and meditation as well as in Transformational Yoga\u00ae and communication.\n\nSusan Douglass\nSusan Douglass started her career in the health and fitness industry before moving into many roles including her own business in IT and Telecommunications.
