Content leaders need to zoom out from the everyday and understand the purpose for content in their organisation, whether it be for reputational or performance purposes.\u00a0To help you do that, this module will cover:\n\nbest practice case studies of content programs\nimportant differences between reputation and performance content programs\nopen Q&A, group work and discussion\n\n\nModule two - building strong content strategy foundations\n\n\nA documented content strategy is the single most important thing any content leader needs, regardless of the type and size of their content program. But content calendars, production workflows and marketing plans are often used in place of a deliberate, well-researched, audience-focused content strategy and that makes life difficult for anyone involved in the content program.\n\nTo help you up level your content strategy, this module will cover:\n\ndeveloping and writing your content mission\nidentifying and prioritising your target audiences\nconducting qualitative and quantitative research\ndefining a useful channel plan and measurement framework\nopen Q&A, group work and discussion\n\n\n\n\nModule three - operationalising your content strategy\nThe best content strategy in the world doesn\u2019t mean anything if it\u2019s not supported by a practical and realistic plan for the day-to-day running of your content program. Content leaders need clarity about their team\u2019s workload, stakeholder buy-in and content distribution as well as the technology they use to track all that.\n\nTo help you come to grips with these priorities, this module will cover:\n\n\nsuccessfully working with other teams or agencies\ndeveloping the right processes and workflows\nchoosing fit-for-purpose tech\nimplementing a paid distribution plan\nopen Q&A, group work and discussion\n\n\n\n\nModule four - optimising your content program\nContent leaders are so busy and often dealing with competing demands, so optimisation often falls by the wayside. There are a few easy ways to extract lessons from your content program as well as poaching other brands\u2019 ideas and ways of working. We\u2019ve learned a thing or two over many years of running content programs and we want to share these hacks with you.\n\nTo help you get the most from your content program, this module will cover:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe kinds of tools and tactics that successful content brands are using\napplying these lessons to your own content program\nopen Q&A, group work and discussion\n\nWhat's included in the ticket price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasterclass attendees will get value from the full-day in two ways. First, there\u2019s the tangible stuff you\u2019ll walk away with and then (perhaps more importantly) there are the skills you\u2019ll discover.Tangible stuff first. At the end of the day, you\u2019re going to walk away with a stack of materials. Expect the following:\n\na masterclass workbook summarising all the key points discussed during the day\nmasterclass worksheets showing how to implement the skills you\u2019ve discovered\nall the complete presentation decks that we\u2019ll use throughout the day\nto be well fed and caffeinated (or decaffeinated, if that\u2019s your thing)\n\nNext, the skills (and this is where it gets interesting!). The masterclass modules are designed to shift your abilities up a notch, not give you a theoretical introduction to content strategy and operations. So, expect to have discovered the following how-to skills:\n\nClearly understand and define your brand\u2019s content purpose\nConduct effective content strategy research (qualitative and quantitative)\nIdentify your target audiences and the needs your content can help them with\nArticulate a range of content pillars or themes for your brand\nDevelop an actionable set of plans for content distribution and measurement\nIntegrate your content program with key teams and agencies\nSecure buy-in from senior stakeholders for your content program\nImplement the right processes and workflows to enable your content program\nAssess and choose the best tech to support your content strategy\nIdentify lessons from other brands\u2019 content efforts to apply to your own brand\n\nYou\u2019ll also get extensive one-on-one time with the three of us so you can ask specific questions that relate to your personal challenges and opportunities when it comes to running a content program.\n\nFor full details about the masterclass, visit\u00a0www.contentleadersacademy.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The masterclass modules are designed to shift your abilities up a notch, not give you a theoretical introduction to content strategy and operations. So, expect to have discovered the following how-to skills:\n<UL>\n<LI>Clearly understand and define your brand\u2019s content purpose</LI>\n<LI>Conduct effective content strategy research (qualitative and quantitative)</LI>\n<LI>Identify your target audiences and the needs your content can help them with</LI>\n<LI>Articulate a range of content pillars or themes for your brand</LI>\n<LI>Develop an actionable set of plans for content distribution and measurement</LI>\n<LI>Integrate your content program with key teams and agencies</LI>\n<LI>Secure buy-in from senior stakeholders for your content program</LI>\n<LI>Implement the right processes and workflows to enable your content program</LI>\n<LI>Assess and choose the best tech to support your content strategy</LI>\n<LI>Identify lessons from other brands\u2019 content efforts to apply to your own brand</LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>You\u2019ll also get extensive one-on-one time with the three of us so you can ask specific questions that relate to your personal challenges and opportunities when it comes to running a content program.</DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"image-title sqs-dynamic-text\"><BR></DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"image-title sqs-dynamic-text\">For full details about the masterclass, visit\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://www.contentleadersacademy.com\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.contentleadersacademy.com</A>.</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>\n</DIV>"

CPI\u2019s Editor in Chief Sam Sadden has interviewed Professor of Competition Law at the College of Europe and former regulator at the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, Philip Marsden.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCPI had the pleasure to sit down today with Philip Marsden, Professor of Competition Law at the College of Europe and former regulator at the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority. Professor Marsden will be delivering the opening keynote address at CPI\u2019s upcoming conference at Melbourne Law School on April 30th\u00a0entitled \"Dynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis conference is co-organized by CPI and CLEN.\u00a0\r\nSee the full program of the conference and register free here\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nListen to the full interview here\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Interview\u00a0Transcript\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden: CPI has the pleasure to sit down today with Philip Marsden, Professor Competition Law at the College of Europe and former regulator at the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority. Professor Marsden will be giving his keynote address at CPI\u2019s upcoming conference at Melbourne Law School on Tuesday, April 30thentitled \u201cDynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nSo Professor Marsden, as a member of the UK Furman Inquiry Panel, please\u00a0 give us the elevator pitch or some top bullet points for the recently released report entitled \u201cUnlocking Digital Competition.\u201d\r\nMarsden: Sure Sam, thanks, and good to talk to you. So in a bit of a summary, we feel that competition policy and law enforcement needs a reset. We think there are certain aspects of markets that tip, especially digital markets, that require more than antitrust law enforcement in terms of an\u00a0ex-post\u00a0approach to ensure that real consumer harms don't occur. We, therefore, recommended an\u00a0ex-ante\u00a0pro-competitive regulatory approach in addition to some changes to antitrust law enforcement.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden: You recently spoke at the FTC hearings and described two antitrust campaigns with a parallel to Brexit terminology, the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign and the \u201cStay\u201d campaign. Could you explain and expand on this a bit and for further reference, listeners should check out the recent CPI Europe Column piece you wrote on the topic \u201cLeave, Remain & Common Ground: Pragmatism in Dealing with Tech Giants.\u201d\r\nMarsden:\u00a0Well, one of the things we noticed with our six-month review in the Furman Report and the evidence taking, we brought in, there was a really polarized set of debates. \u201cLeavers\u201d in the antitrust world, I feel are trying to leave the consumer welfare standard, leave evidence-based analysis, leave expert-driven decision making and leave indeed independent decision making and indeed leave enforcement, leave\u00a0ex-post\u00a0enforcement. And just intervene, do breakups, market share caps, structural divestments, and price caps if need be. The other side of the campaign is the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign who essentially are either the big tech companies or in some cases some of the competition authorities who are saying \u201cmove along, nothing to look at here.\u201d If they're a tech company, they say,\u00a0\u201cLook, competition is a click away. Data is free, don't worry about it and you should be grateful for all the innovation.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\nAnd if they're a competition authority, many of those authorities say, \"Just leave us to continue with our antitrust enforcement, leveraging theories, installation theories, abuse of dominance theories, and we'll just bring more of those cases and we'll just be a bit braver.\" And we felt that the Furman Report, that there's something in between both of those, not a third way, not a middle way. It's actually closer to the \u201cRemainer\u201d way, which is speeding up antitrust law enforcement, changing some aspects of merger control and developing a pro-competitive regulatory code to bring out some\u00a0ex-ante\u00a0codes of conduct for digital companies that have strategic market status, so that they actually don't do the harms in the first place.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden:\u00a0I think we can all look for some common ground on a lot of different levels, not only for antitrust. Next, I would like to discuss the issue of data portability. Open Banking in the UK is often referenced as a benchmark for data portability. How do you, or should you, take the approach which has been adopted for that sector and apply it to different industries with different business models?\r\nMarsden:\u00a0Sure. Well, I had the great\u00a0honor\u00a0of being the deputy chair of the CMA\u2019s Open Banking Inquiry. And what we found there was very similar to the \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d antitrust debate I just mentioned, which is we had a great deal of popular pressure and political pressure to break up the banks, which indeed are platforms for many other services and digital in many ways as well. And we had\u00a0a great deal of\u00a0arguments from the banks that nothing needed to be done. They just needed to get a bit more engaged with their consumers.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\nAnd we found that open banking remedies and data portability remedies would actually give consumers and FinTech intermediaries better ability to introduce competitive services and essentially, you know, to cut through it to the chase, to make sure that banks that were perhaps sitting on old IT systems and not even using their own consumer data would have that sort of feel of people chasing after them.\r\nSort of the breath on the back of the neck thing of a runner behind them to induce them to indeed engage with their own consumers. So we were trying to stimulate incumbent's, doing more for their consumers through better engagement, and we were trying to stimulate entry to try to create that discipline as well. And indeed in\u00a0Britain,\u00a0we found that the measure of success wasn't switching. Indeed, our evidence showed that more Britain's switch their spouses more frequently than they switch their banks. We understood that they're well likely to stay with their own particular banking platform and this is what they may well want to do with their own digital platform indeed. But we want to see more competition within those services that those platforms offer and hopefully more opportunities for the big platforms that need to feel some competitive pressure.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden:\u00a0\u00a0I have a quote from you, from CNN I believe, stating that, \"Antitrust authorities are increasingly concerned when platforms act as gatekeepers.\" Can you please give an example of this and what are some of the pros and cons of this development?\r\nMarsden:\u00a0 Sure, so I think that on this \u201cLeave\u201d side of the campaign, you see some governments indeed have said, \"Look, we don't even want these large platforms selling their own products on their own platforms. They're a gatekeeper for third party suppliers and we don't want that even happening.\" And indeed, one government has legislated against this in particular happening.\r\nOther countries are being more careful but are bringing\u00a0abuse\u00a0of dominance cases about this sort of argument that if you are the retailers so to\u00a0speak\u00a0or the owner of the platform, you have an opportunity to\u00a0favor\u00a0your own services over others. And this kind of\u00a0favoritism\u00a0happens all the time in the offline world, and it is probably happening in the online world as well, too. But the question is, is there any harm to consumers net. And so what we're noticing is a kind of a competition among competition policies and legislators to try to address these issues.\r\nBut what I think we have to do, first of all, is work out whether there's any real harm indeed. Our Furman Report feels that there is a degree of harm there and therefore we felt that rather than chase after these big platforms in a differentiated approach around the world and equally having the platform companies and their advisors play Whac-A-Mole with follow-on enforcement around the world, why don't we set out an agreed code of conduct\u00a0ex-ante\u00a0for what is and isn't permissible on these platforms, and then everybody can get on with actually bringing these great services to market.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden: And lastly, referencing the title of the upcoming conference in Melbourne on April 30th\u00a0what do you think are some steps towards a path forward for dynamic competition in dynamic markets?\r\nMarsden:\u00a0It's a really exciting time in this policy space at least because I do think that unlike the other \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d space, there's hope for some common ground. So you've got the fabulous interim report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. You've got the European trio report, you've got various words from the Furman Report and other jurisdictions. You've got actual deeds, not just words, deeds in the Netherlands, in France, and in Germany with respect to actual enforcement. So if anything, I think there's a great deal of pressure to come up with something that identifies a common ground. And indeed, I think the tech companies want that as well, so they don't have to deal with so many divergent regimes.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSadden:\u00a0\u00a0Well, thank you once again, Professor\u00a0Marsden,\u00a0for sitting down with CPI for this interview and we look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, April 30thin Melbourne for the CPI conference, \u201cDynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward.\u201d We hope to see many of our listeners there.

But the question is, is there any harm to consumers net. And so what we're noticing is a kind of a competition among competition policies and legislators to try to address these issues.</SPAN></I></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\"><I><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">But what I think we have to do, first of all, is work out whether there's any real harm indeed. Our Furman Report feels that there is a degree of harm there and therefore we felt that rather than chase after these big platforms in a differentiated approach around the world and equally having the platform companies and their advisors play Whac-A-Mole with follow-on enforcement around the world, why don't we set out an agreed code of conduct\u00a0</SPAN></I><EM><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal;\">ex-ante</SPAN></EM><I><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0for what is and isn't permissible on these platforms, and then everybody can get on with actually bringing these great services to market.</SPAN></I></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\">\u00a0</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #080d8c;\"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Sadden: </SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">And lastly, referencing the title of the upcoming conference in Melbourne on April 30<SUP>th\u00a0</SUP>what do you think are some steps towards a path forward for dynamic competition in dynamic markets?</SPAN></SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\"><SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Marsden:\u00a0</SPAN></STRONG><I><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">It's a really exciting time in this policy space at least because I do think that unlike the other \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d space, there's hope for some common ground. So you've got the fabulous interim report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. You've got the European trio report, you've got various words from the Furman Report and other jurisdictions. You've got actual deeds, not just words, deeds in the Netherlands, in France, and in Germany with respect to actual enforcement. So if anything, I think there's a great deal of pressure to come up with something that identifies a common ground. And indeed, I think the tech companies want that as well, so they don't have to deal with so many divergent regimes.</SPAN></I></SPAN><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 13.5pt;\">\u00a0</SPAN></P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\">\u00a0</P>\r\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\" STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #080d8c;\"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Sadden:\u00a0</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0Well, thank you once again, Professor\u00a0Marsden,\u00a0for sitting down with CPI for this interview and we look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, April 30<SUP>th</SUP>in Melbourne for the CPI conference, \u201cDynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward.\u201d We hope to see many of our listeners there.

                "text": "AGILE FOR LEADERS\nAgility is a mindset, not a methodology.\nAt Next Paradigm, we understand that not everyone wants, or needs, to be a Scrum Master - the benefits of Agile and Lean are available to the whole organisation, not just software developers.\nAgile for Leaders is a one-day workshop for anyone who wants to learn how to incorporate Agile and Lean Thinking into their, and their team's, daily work practice.\nWORKSHOP OUTLINE\nBUSINESS AGILITY AND THE PROMISE OF AGILE\nPLANNED WORK\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Agile Product Owner in a Nutshell \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Minimum Viable Product\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Features, Stories, Tasks and Acceptance Criteria\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Prioritisation & Estimation\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Planning the Sprint and The Agile Wall\nUNPLANNED WORK\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Realising Value through Kanban\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Kanban Activity\nAGILE GOVERNANCE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 High Level Planning\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Showcase\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Measuring Progress\nRETROSPECTIVE AND CLOSE\n\nFAQs\nHow can I contact the organiser\u00a0with any questions?You can reach us with your questions anytime at info@nextparadigm.com.au\nWhat's the refund policy?Tickets are refundable up to 30 days before the event. With less than 30 days to the event, tickets are non-refundable, but are transferable - see below.\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?No, we keep a record of all attendees, so you do not require your ticket on the day.\nCan I update my registration information?Yes. If you need to update any information, simply send an email to info@nextparadigm.com.au with your Order Number and changes you'd like to make.\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?Your ticket is transferable to anyone else in your organisation, up to 48 hours before the workshop. If you would like to transfer your ticket, please send details of the transferee with your Order Number to info@nextparadigm.com.au.\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\"The Agile for Leaders workshop was a valuable source of practical information for applying Agile to everyday tasks. Next Paradigm delivered an informative, jargon-free session which was accessible to all regardless of their background in the organisation.\"\nNathan Price,\u00a0Director (a/g) eServices, Administrative Appeals Tribunal\n\n\u201cAs an experienced PM and BA, I thought the course was pitched at just the right level. Having said that, others in my course did not have my experience, yet seemed to understand the content just as well.
