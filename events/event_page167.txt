The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized\u00a0Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification\u00a0exam.\nUnlike the\u00a0Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course\u00a0which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM II is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.\nWho Should Attend\nThe Professional Scrum Master II course is an advanced course specifically designed for experienced Scrum Masters who have a thorough understanding of the Scrum framework. \u00a0It is particularly beneficial for those people with at least one year of Scrum Master experience.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nOver the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Scrum Master such as how the principles and values of Scrum help guide Scrum Masters in the decisions they make and how the Scrum Master can help change the environment of Scrum Teams, creating an environment for agility to thrive.\u00a0The Scrum Master role is complex and often, a Scrum Master must be able to apply different stances in order to be effective, such as:\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Teacher\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Facilitator\n\n\nThe Scrum Master as a Change Agent\n\n\nAs a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.\nAs a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent. \u00a0Throughout the class, your PST will provide\u00a0stories,\u00a0exercises, facilitation techniques (such as \u201cLiberating Structures\u201d), resources and more.\nThere will also be time in class for the Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) to provide coaching on challenges that you and\u00a0your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy Scrum.org\nScrum.org provides the highest quality Scrum training, training materials and certified Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to teach them. Our training materials are created and maintained by Scrum co-creator Ken Schwaber, Scrum.org and the community of PSTs who teach the courses, helping to ensure that they are in tune with what\u2019s happening in software development organizations and always up-to-date with the latest practices.\nProfessional Scrum Trainers bring their own style and experience to the courses, but use the same materials so that students are learning from the same content regardless of who teaches the course or where it is taught around the world. \u00a0Read more\u00a0about the differences.\nYour Trainer - Rich Visotcky\n\"It is my mission to help people leverage different perspectives and new approaches to connect with what is truly important in their situation and solve the challenges they are facing.

The lesson is simple: to turn an idea into a profitable business you need to plan every stage of how you will take it to market. And that rule applies whether you\u2019ve already invested hours in development or whether your new product or service is yet to be tested.  Get on top of everything you need to consider, from protecting your intellectual property, to market testing, steps to market entry, what sort of finance you\u2019ll need to get there and where to source it.  Be guided by an experienced innovation and commercialisation practitioner with over 30 years' experience to build a deeper understanding of the business potential of your idea, innovation or invention and get the right support and advice.  This five and a half hour workshop, held over two sessions, includes two free follow-up one-on-one mentoring sessions offering tailored advice to develop a commercialisation strategy that will keep you on track from day one.  Get yourself right up to speed about all the steps that will take your innovation to market, at this essential Small Business Victoria workshop, one of many that have helped businesses get started in Victoria for more than 10 years.

After an apprenticeship in photography which culminated in a diploma, Heide studied advertising, gaining a second diploma. After a spell as an industrial photographer, Heide worked as a photojournalist for four years until her marriage in 1963, travelling to England as Mrs Smith. In 1971 the Smith family emigrated to Australia, where Heide worked as a photojournalist and\u00a0later in a professional colour laboratory. In 1978 the family moved to Canberra, where Heide established a studio, which she ran until 1997. Since 1998, Heide and her husband Brian have lived in Narooma, a small fishing village in NSW.

Moore was to work for Life magazine, Time and The Observer before returning to Australia in the late 1950s.\nIn their photographic works Max Dupain, Wolfgang Sievers and David Moore capture the beauty of the natural landscape, the construction of modern-day cities, the work and play of those who live in them.

Many are also accredited counsellors.</P>\r\n<H2>Community information resources</H2>\r\n<P>When faced with a crisis, individuals often do not know how to access appropriate assistance.\u00a0 With this in mind, Wesley LifeForce has developed \u2018community information cards\u2019 and \u2018community information posters\u2019. Every workshop participant receives a community information card which includes national 24-hour crisis numbers and information about local community services/resources.</P>\r\n<H2>Ensuring participant safety</H2>\r\n<P>All workshop material is specifically designed with participant\u2019s safety in mind. Our course material is vetted by MindFrame \u2013 an Australian Government body which provides expert advice to the Suicide Prevention Sector on responsible reporting/portrayal of the issue of suicide.</P>\r\n<H2>The outcomes</H2>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>understand risk and protective factors</LI>\r\n<LI>how to identify the warning signs that someone may be at risk of suicide</LI>\r\n<LI>how to ask directly about suicide intent.</LI>\r\n<LI>understand what local and national support and resources are available to support a person at risk.</LI>\r\n</UL>"

After joining the company in 2011, he built an investment team focusing on clean energy and sustainable technologies, and this has become one of the leading investors in that sector in the UK. His team\u2019s focus is on backing companies based on world class science that have scalable solutions for climate change and other environmental issues. Robert has served on the boards of 16 portfolio companies over his 8 years at IP Group, and his current boards are on Ceres Power, First Light Fusion, Spinetic Energy and RFC Power.\r\nPrior to IP Group, Robert was Head of Research and Development at the Carbon Trust, a UK government agency set up to support businesses in the transition to a low carbon economy. He set up their Research Accelerator, which invested in and supported cleantech start-ups in areas of strategic interest to the UK government. He has also worked as a strategy consultant with McKinsey & Company and as a scientist carrying out research in universities (Cambridge and Imperial) and within cleantech start-ups, where he focused on novel materials for fuel cells. Robert has a Masters and PhD in materials science from the University of Cambridge, where he graduated top of his class.\r\nIn addition to his work at IP Group, Robert serves as a Commissioner for the Energy Transitions Commission, a global group of leaders from industry, finance and public life who are working to accelerate the transition to zero-carbon energy, industry and transport. As the venture capitalist in the group, Robert brings knowledge of new technologies from start-ups to the Commissions\u2019 work. Robert is also a member of the UK Government Green Finance Taskforce and advises Ministers and other stakeholders on the development of a thriving green finance industry in the UK. \r\n____\r\nTRANSPORT AND PARKING INFORMATION\r\nIt is extremely difficult to find parking at ANU during the day - we advise using public transport, taxi, cycling or walking. Transport advice for getting to the ANU Acton campus can be found here\r\nIf you have to drive, arrive early, allow plenty of time to find a park and walk to your destination. For parking advice, visit the ANU website link here. Here is an interactive map and a pdf map version of parking zones on the campus.\r\nThere are areas of Pay As You Go, which is facilitated by Cello-Park, to set up an account and register your car - click here - they also have an app interface in case you are using your mobile device. There are also areas of ticket parking that accept coins and cards for purchasing tickets.",
