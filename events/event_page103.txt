This allows you to deploy sensors, for example:\n- Read weather data from outside- Obtain live data from machinery- Monitor population levels around town- Run sensor monitors around your house- Turn lights and other devices on and off remotely- Lock your door from your smartphone\nand much, much more.\nThe workshops are set at two levels, beginner and intermediate. The beginner workshop is slower paced and focuses on the basics of connecting a device to the internet and communicating with it. The intermediate workshop is faster paced and delves more in-depth and has more complex examples.\nAs part of the workshops you will get to take home your own Internet of Things sensor!\n\u00a0\nBeginner: Thursday 18th April -\u00a0 9am to 3pm\nIntermediate: Saturday May 18th - 9am to 3pm\n\u00a0\nLocation: Ballarat Hackerspace: 124A Albert St, Ballarat Central, 3350\nAccess via stairs on the South of the building .\u00a0\n\nIf you need accessible access, please contact us separately at committee@ballarathackerspace.org.au for us to arrange this.\n\u00a0\nIf you complete the beginner workshop, you could also then follow up with the intermediate course, which will lead in to more specific examples of using the Internet of Things for your business.\n\nBoth workshops expect some experience with programming and electronics, but if you don't have this, let us know and we can work out what you need to know beforehand.\nUnder 18s are welcome, but must be with a guardian over 18 who is responsible for them.

Working with shamanic and magical arts, we will learn techniques to enhance geomantic practice. This includes Protection Protocols, Banishings, and Rituals for Working Safely and Clearing Space.\u00a0\nTopics include:\n\n\nProtection: personal and house protection; protocols for spirit work; shielding, banishing and wards\n\n\nGeopsychic Stress: overview of geopsychic phenomena; identification and release of earthbound ghosts and entities; communicating, dialoguing and healing in spirit work\n\n\nPortals: identifying and determining the nature of portals; opening and closing where appropriate\n\n\nCurses: ethics and psychology; identifying and removing curses\u00a0\n\n\nSpace Clearing: creating \u2018sweet\u2019 space using ritual form\n\n\nGeomantic Healing Protocol\n\n\nSite and Practical Work\u00a0\n\n\nNo previous knowledge or experience required.\n\nEnrolments now open.\nPayment options and plans available, see\u00a0our website\n\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity to learn with UK-based\u00a0Jewels Rocka of\u00a0Land and Spirit, a professional geomancer working in the field. Jewels has been practicing feng shui, geomancy, counselling, astrology and shiatsu for over 25 years in many parts of the world.\u00a0Her passion for the work, and her down-to-earth and engaging teaching style makes her workshops incredibly informative and lots of fun.\n\nTake the plunge and change the way you experience the world.\nCome and join us at one of our workshops and develop your geomantic eyes.\n\nAs well as providing the theory and history underpinning geomancy, our workshops are very hands-on, so you'll come away confident to start using everything you've learnt.\nSee\u00a0our website\u00a0for more information and to see what\u00a0other workshops we have on offer.\n\u00a0\nPlease note, this description is an indication of topics; we reserve the right to substitute or reprogram content and dates as necessary.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nEmail us\u00a0via our website and we'll answer any questions you have. You can also check out the\u00a0FAQs\u00a0on our website \u2013 your question might be answered there.\n\nI don't have any experience, is this ok?\nYes.\u00a0No\u00a0prior knowledge is required for any of our workshops.\u00a0Our classes usually have students with a range of experience levels, from none whatsoever\u00a0to healers and energy workers or those with a feng shui background, and all have equally kept up with the content and been challenged to learn something new. The beauty of geomancy is that\u00a0it helps people weave together so many of their interests and knowledge areas into a rich and meaningful practice. Everyone\u2019s way of practicing geomancy becomes really unique according to their personal journey.\n\nWhat do I need to bring to the workshop?\nWe'll be in touch before the workshop with further details about the venue (getting there, PT options, parking etc.), what to bring and items that will be available to purchase (e.g. dowsing equipment if you don't have any). But usually all you need to bring along is a pen and paper, and any dowsing tools (rods or a pendulum) if you have them.\n\nWhat's the refund policy?\nOur full refund policy is outlined in our\u00a0Terms and Conditions\u00a0on our website.\nCourse fees are due in full prior to the course commencement date. The course fee includes a non-refundable deposit of 25%.\nAll registrations for this course that are cancelled 60 days or more prior to the class starting\u00a0will be refunded in full less the deposit amount. If cancellation occurs 60 days or more prior to the class starting the deposit can be transferred to another Geomancy Australia workshop.\nCourse fees are non-refundable after 60 days prior to the class starting.\nWe reserve the right to cancel the course if it does not meet the minimum enrolment numbers, or in the event of exceptional circumstances. Where cancellation occurs, we will provide (where possible) alternative dates for course delivery, or a full refund of the course fees.\nWorkshop numbers are limited. Enrolment is not guaranteed until full payment is made. In the case of concessions and instalments, if they are not paid when due we reserve the right to cancel the enrolment.\nWe reserve the right to refuse enrolment, or withdraw enrolment of anybody at any time. If this occurs and payment has been made, it will be refunded in full or pro rata, deducting payment for workshop time already completed.\n\nCan I update my registration information?\nYes, just\u00a0contact us\u00a0and let us know if any of your details change.\n\nCan I bring my child to the workshop?\nIn order not to distract the educators and other students, children (or anyone not enrolled as a student) are not to be brought to class. Some content discussed is not appropriate for minors and classes cannot be altered to avoid this.",

Hypnobirthing Australia\u2122\u00a0classes prepare you with the knowledge, confidence and tools you need to birth calmly. Birth can, and should be, a positive experience \u2013 one that you will always want to remember!\n\nAs a hypnobirthing mama myself I know first hand how empowering the experience of positive birth can be. Like you may also be feeling though, I was filled with fear at the thought of how I would manage the intensity of birth.\u00a0I doubted my ability to birth calmly and naturally, and my partner wasn't sure how best to support me. Undertaking the Hypnobirthing Australia\u2122 course was one of the best decisions I made for my pregnancy and birth. I came away with a repetoire of tools that helped me experience the positive entry into motherhood I always desired. Giving birth to my daughter was the best day of my life! I believe in the power of hypnobirthing so passionately that I am now a certified Hypnobirthing Australia\u2122 Practitioner myself.\u00a0I endeavour to give mums to be and their partners all of the tools to make their own child's birth the most empowering day of their life\u00a0\n\nSo what does the 'hypno' part mean?\nThe 'hypno' part of hypnobirthing refers to one of the core tools you will learn in the course, self hypnosis. Far from been a 'hippie' or 'new age' method, self hypnosis is actually a very deep state of relaxation that allows us to birth very instictivly and naturally. If you've ever lost track of what the teacher was saying while you drifted off in the relaxation at yoga, or arrived home after a long drive with no concept of how you got there you have actually already experienced a hypnotic state. Hypnotherapy can help our birth to be a calm and relaxed experience, conditioning us to let go of fear and release endorphins.\n\nWhat else will I learn?\nThe Positive Birth Program by Hypnobirthing Australia\u2122 course empowers you with the very latest of evidenced based birth information, along with practical techniques that you and your birth partner can practise leading up to, and during your birth. Combining relaxation, visualisation, self-hypnosis, breathing techniques and more, you and your birth partner will come away feeling excited and prepared to meet your baby.\u00a0\n\nWhen should I participate in the course?\nYou can begin Hypnobirthing any time, but we recommend that the optimal time to start your course is between 20 and 30 weeks. This will give you time to practise the self-hypnosis, relaxation and other effective techniques for gentle, easy birthing but also ensures that the course is still fresh in your mind. However if you are further along, it's never too late to prepare for your own beautiful, calm birth.\n\nAll the details:\nWhen: Saturday and Sunday - May 18th & 19th (9.30am - 4pm)\nWhere: Movement Remedies, 8 Gurwood St, Wagga Wagga\u00a0\nInvestment: $495 (includes the mother and birth partner attending the whole course)\nNote: $150 deposit required to secure your place, remainder due prior to course\n\n\nNeed more info?

Fears and beliefs such as: being misunderstood, not feeling good enough or smart enough, concerns of how our opinions will be perceived, or sometimes how we deep down believe we \u201cshould\u201d act.\nOther times, it is the behaviours and biases of others (being treated differently as a woman) that hold you back by silencing or quieting your voice.\nWhichever you\u2019re up against, both can be challenging to overcome and can have long-term negative effects on your career if you don\u2019t find a solution. \nIn this application-based course you learn how to identify and reduce the impact of bias in the workplace. You will also receive real-time coaching on your communication habits and walk away with specific communication strategies that you can put to use immediately.\u00a0As a bonus, we will introduce you to a community of like-minded female professionals. \nUltimately, this course helps current and future female leaders (like you!) to identify and remove the speed bumps and roadblocks caused by bias in the workplace so you can maximise the strongest tool you have...your voice!\n\nEARLY BIRD TICKETS STILL AVAILABLE!\nThe Early Birds get a massive worm! 20% off to be exact!\nClick 'Tickets' to reserve your seat now!\n\n\nWhat Will I Learn in this Course?\nDay 1 (10am- 4pm): Mastering Your Self Talk, Mindset, Limiting Beliefs, and Any Self-Inflicting Biases Within You.\nThe unequal treatment in the workplace can take its toll on how we perceive and talk to ourselves. On Day 1, you will remove any roadblocks you place in front of yourself. You will learn... \n\n\nWhat \u2018Self-Inflicting Biases\u2019 are and how to remove them. \n\n\nHow to identify the common - and not so common - limiting beliefs female leaders experience and eliminate the ones holding you back.\n\n\nSpecific techniques and tools to change your mindset and internal voice from a \u2018Critic\u2019 to a \u2018Coach\u2019.\n\n\nStep-by-step strategies to identify and change the communication habits that can reduce your impact.\n\n\nHow to articulate your strengths confidently to others without feeling like you\u2019re bragging.\n\n\nDay 2: (10am - 4pm) Navigating Gender Bias, Developing Strong Communication Habits, and Amplifying Your Voice to Others.\nNext, we turn outward and develop strategies for how to navigate the bias you may experience in the workplace. You will learn...\n\n\nThe foundations and underpinnings of gender bias and how they affect you in 2019.\n\n\nThe skills and tools required to successfully identify and navigate bias from clients or coworkers.\n\n\n\u2018In-the-moment\u2019 strategies for how to react and respond to unequal treatment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nUse a simple and effective communication framework to have productive feedback conversations around biases.\n\n\n\n\nLimited Seats Available.\u00a0\nAct Fast and Save Big (20% Off Ends Soon)!\nClick 'Tickets' to Reserve Your Seat Today.\n\n\nIs this course designed for me?\nWill you benefit from this course?
