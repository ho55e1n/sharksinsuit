Our classes focus on learning the traditional strokes, and we use black ink on paper to start practicing and to learn the basics. Our classes are designed for beginner to people who have some previous skills who like to restart practicing on a regular basis. We will introduce water/ink painting and do modern watercolor drawings too.\nThis is an adult class. All materials included.

                "text": "\nQueerspace Youth at Drummond Street Services and the Family Violence Recovery Support team at Thorne Harbour Health have partnered again to present a Clothes Swap for the Queer, Trans and Gender Non-conforming community. We had such an amazing time at the last clothes swap in November and we\u2019re so excited for a winter edition!! This time we\u2019re holding it at a bigger venue and will also have performances by local musicians throughout the day!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the event:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that sometimes it\u2019s hard to find clothes that represent your true self and that going shopping can be inaccessible due to costs, the existence of queer/transphobia and fashion that is made exclusively for certain body types.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to provide a space where people can come to a central spot, bring some clothes that they no longer want or need and pass these onto someone who would appreciate them. It could be those platform heels, binders, glitter halter tops, jeans, band shirts, jackets, coats etc!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the event details:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere: Schoolhouse Studios (81 Rupert Street, Collingwood).\n\n\nWhen: Saturday 22nd June 12pm - 4pm\n\n\nCost: Free\n\n\nWho: All ages!\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n\n\nQueerspace Youth provides a social and supportive space for people who identify as Queer, Trans*, non binary, Intersex, gender diverse/non conforming, and questioning, who are aged between 18-25. We aim to provide spaces that will allow to connect to other people who have a similar experience through workshops, social events and monthly support groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThorne Harbour Health provides social and support services to the LGBTQIA+ community including peer support, sexual health, counselling and support services for those who have experienced intimate partner and family violence. \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth organisations acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation as the Traditional Custodians of this Land. We also pay respect to Elders both past and present. We acknowledge the resilience of the Kulin nations throughout the ongoing struggle to resist colonisation in this country for over 230 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility information is included below. If you have any accessibility needs or questions, please contact Queerspace Youth through facebook, or email ruby.cameron@ds.org.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting there\n\n\n\n\n\nSchoolhouse Studios is located at 81 Rupert Street Collingwood and there will be a map posted on the event page closer to the date. The footpath on Rupert street is 168cm wide, mainly flat but is interspersed with driveways that are at a curb-sized incline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe venue is 500m from Collingwood Station (Hurstbridge and Mernda Lines), 450m from Hoddle Street/Gipps Street bus stop and 800m from the route 86 tram stop at the corner of Smith and Gertrude Streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is limited free all day parking (no restriction after 12.30pm on Saturdays) on Rupert Street and on nearby Gipps and Langridge Streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering the venue\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is flat concrete entry from footpath to entrance of Schoolhouse Studios, and a curb-sized incline from street to entrance. The door will remain open throughout the event and it is 112cm wide. The door table where you will be greeted when entering the event will be located immediately to the left of the entrance, and clothes swap staff can be sought out if assistance is needed getting in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor space\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a partially covered outdoor space at the venue. This space will have tables (77cm tall), long wooden benches and wooden chairs with back support available. The outdoor space is located in front of the entrance to the venue.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside venue\n\n\n\n\n\nThe floor of the venue is flat concrete, as it is a warehouse there are some areas where there are breaks in the concrete that are approx 1cm deep. The venue has high, warehouse style glass and metal ceilings with lots of natural light. Fairy lights and stage lights may be used during the event, no strobe lights will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce arriving at the venue, visitors will be directed to a sorting table where they can hang any clothing they are donating on hangers and then place these items on corresponding clothes racks. Clothes swap staff will be at this table to help those who need assistance with this.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be racks and tables set up according to clothing type (e.g. pants, tops, dresses etc) as well as dedicated racks for sizes 16 and over. Please be mindful that people who wear sizes 16+ will be prioritized for racks with these sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be signed priority seating available at the venue, including priority seating close to the stage when musical acts will perform. Set times for the performances will be posted on the event page closer to the date.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe venue is a large drafty space however there are heaters located in the venue which will be utilized when cold. As it will be a winter clothes swap we suggest bringing warm clothes for the outdoors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many power points located throughout the venue and there will be a space where people can charge mobility and communication devices if required.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be quiet music played throughout the event from 12 - 2.30pm and then loud music by live musical acts played from 2.30 - 4pm. Free ear plugs will be available at the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be free snacks, mocktails, juice, coffee and tea available at this event. There will be vegan and gluten free options, but please feel welcome to bring your own food to the event as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBathrooms\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are all gender two toilets at the venue. Both toilets are located at the back of the venue. The flat concrete floor turns into a stone floor as it approaches the toilets so is not completely flat - there are some bumpy areas approximately 1-3cm deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll gender toilet that is not wheelchair accessible: There is a hallway leading to 1 all gender toilet and a room with sinks to wash hands in - the door leading to this hallway is 77cm wide. The door that leads to the toilet cubicle is 76cm wide, and toilet cubicle door is 67cm wide. There is a seperate room with sinks to wash your hands - there is 1 step to access this room that is approx 15cm tall.\n\n\n\n\n\nWheelchair accessible toilet: the cubicle does not have an automatic door and will need to be opened via a handle, the door itself is 89cm wide and is not heavy to pull open. Once inside, the toilet door is locked via twisting the lock shut. The floor of the toilet is flat concrete. There is an L shaped rand rail to the right of the toilet and a horizontal handrail to the left. The space between the left of the toilet and far wall is 193cm wide. \n\n\n\n",

Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\n~~~\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening.
