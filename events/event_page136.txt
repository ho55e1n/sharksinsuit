The solution is to shape the essence of your science into a story.\nTwo experienced science communicators will work with you to find the story in your research.

And you\u2019ll get the chance to practice being interviewed in front of a camera and on tape.\nThe day\u2019s insights and training will help you feel more comfortable in dealing with journalists when media opportunities arise.\nWe can also hold courses in other locations or on other dates.
