                "text": "Gather with us for this specialised and supported mindful self-compassion 8-week course.\nMost cultural expectations for women are unattainable, unrealistic and sometimes contradicting. We are bombarded by messages that tell us who, what and how we should be and how we should look. Despite the fact that most\u2014if not all\u2014of these expectations are impossible to meet, we constantly strive to meet them. And when we don\u2019t, we feel inadequate, powerless, isolated and small.\nMaybe there is a way to deal with all these expectations in a more constructive and supportive manner? Maybe we can actually thrive in the midst of constant challenges?\nMindful self-compassion is such a way. Self-compassion is an essential skill to live a happy and meaningful life as a woman.\nWe are not all naturally self-compassionate. And most of us are \u00a0more likely to develop habits of self-criticism and harsh self-judgment rather than self-compassion as we grow up.\nFortunately, anyone can become more mindful and self-compassionate with specialised training and ongoing practice. We can develop a new habit of self-compassion, and literally rewire our brains over the course of eight weeks.\nWhat is mindful self-compassion?\nIn short, self-compassion is \u00a0learning to be kind and supportive to ourselves in moments of doubt, uncertainty, difficulty and failure. It is training in offering ourselves the support, in these moments, that we would offer a good friend\u2014it is a powerful inner resource.\nThe basis of the practice is mindfulness, which allows us to be fully present and attend to our experience and emotions with curiosity and without judgment. Self-compassion goes beyond mindfulness practice in that it develops the additional habit of attending to those experiences which are difficult or challenging with friendliness, kindness and warmth.\nWhy self-compassion? \nA growing body of research has shown that the practice of self-compassion greatly enhances emotional wellbeing and resilience. It boosts happiness, reduces anxiety and depression, improves relationships, and can even help us stick to our goals. We will discuss this research in the course.\n\nSelf-compassion for women\nMindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is an empirically-supported 8-week course designed to cultivate the skill of self-compassion. It was developed by Christopher Germer, PhD, a leader in the integration of mindfulness and psychotherapy, and Kristin Neff, PhD, a pioneering researcher in the field of self-compassion.\nWe will also address the application of self-compassion techniques to the unique challenges that women face (and the straitjackets we wear!) in modern times, such as the need to look perfect and do everything perfectly, to professionally thrive and advance all whilst staying pleasant and unthreatening.\nThis program is about women talking to women and discovering together how to bring more mindfulness and compassion into our daily lives\u2014together. It\u2019s about learning to support ourselves, but also developing networks of compassionate support.\nProgram\nIn this program you will learn how to:\n\n\nManage stress with self-compassion\n\n\nMotivate with kindness rather than criticism\n\n\nLive life closer to your core values\n\n\nHandle difficult emotions with greater ease\n\n\nTransform challenging relationships for the better\n\n\nLive a more meaningful and purposeful life\n\n\nDates\n\n\nSaturday April 27, May 4, 11, 18, 25 and June 1, 8, 15\n\n\nWe will meet once a week on these Saturday mornings from 11:30am to 2 pm.\n\n\nThe course culminates with a half-day retreat: Sunday 23 June from 10 am to 2 pm\n\n\nWhy 8 weeks\nNew habits\u2014particularly those that go against deeply-ingrained old habits\u2014take time, and support, to develop. Research has shown that the self-compassion practice, under appropriate instruction, and over time, can literally rewire our brains. But these changes take time, and research shows that 8 weeks of supported practice is required to experience change, and to give us the best chance of sustaining the practice going forward.\n\nFor whom?\nThis workshop is intended for women of any background. It is designed primarily for personal growth and development. However, professionals who wish to integrate mindful self-compassion into their work activities are also encouraged to attend. Meditation experience, or a background in mindfulness, is not required to participate in this program.\nGroup ethos\nThis workshop will be conducted in a safe, supportive, and phone-free environment and will involve short exercises, guided practices, personal reflection, and a group ethos of deep listening and friendly speech.\n\nPricing\n$655\nConcessions are available for those of limited means and students\u2014please email us.\n\nWho will be facilitating\nJossy Jimenez has a master\u2019s degree in human development and is certified as a mindfulness facilitator by UCLA\u2019s Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behaviour and the Mindful Schools organisation. She has training in Stanford University\u2019s Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) and has completed teacher-training in the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program with UCSD.\nShe has developed wellbeing programs for institutions in Australia, the United States, and Mexico -everything from kindergartens to large corporations. Above all, she is an enthusiastic practitioner who has great personal appreciation for the benefits of these practices.\n\nSuggested reading\nIt is recommended, but not required, that participants read the flowing two books for participating in MSC:\n\n\nSelf-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself \u00a0by Kristin Neff\n\n\nThe Mindful Path to Self-Compassion  by Christopher Germer\n\n\n\nOptional Reading\n\n\nDaring Greatly: How the Courage to be Vulnerable Can Transform the Way we Live, Love, Parent and Lead by Brene Brown\n\n\n\n\nThe Gift of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You\u2019re Supposed To Be and Embrace Who You Are by Brene Brown\n\n",

Listed as one of the top 10 influential macrame artists in 2017 She shows her skill and love of knot tying by creating large improvised original pieces and teaching the skills to others in her studio above Think Thornbury. Maggie May, and her Musician Husband Josh Kelly, founded Think Thornbury in 2017.

Nothing beats that human connection - not even burying your head in your phone or going on a Netflix binge!\r\nAnd these days, networking is more necessary than ever. It\u2019s not just for the job hunters anymore, but an essential tool in our current environment where employment and industries can be temporary and/or uncertain, so it\u2019s good to keep up with the latest opportunities, contacts, apps, venues, grants and so forth.\r\nFor the whole blog read\u00a0here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for organising these Bruno. I had a great time last week. See you and everyone else at the next one!\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHad an absolute blast! Thank you:)\r\n\u00a0\r\nI really enjoyed my first CDNB and look forward to the next. Thank you so much for coordinating and promoting this.

Nothing beats that human connection - not even burying your head in your phone or going on a Netflix binge!</EM></SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN><EM>And these days, networking is more necessary than ever. It\u2019s not just for the job hunters anymore, but an essential tool in our current environment where employment and industries can be temporary and/or uncertain, so it\u2019s good to keep up with the latest opportunities, contacts, apps, venues, grants and so forth.</EM></SPAN></P>\r\n<P><STRONG><EM>For the whole blog read\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/NorthsideLife/posts/1931832827088371\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A>!</EM></STRONG></P>\r\n<P><BR></P>\r\n</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n<P><EM>Thanks for organising these Bruno.
