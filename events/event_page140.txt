                "text": "BREAKTHROUGH:\u00a0ICE EDUCATION FOR FAMILIES\n TOPIC 1:\u00a0FACTS\nThere is a lot of misinformation in the media and public discourse about drug use and ice in\u00a0particular. In this first part of the session we separate fact from fiction. We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.  Most importantly, we explain the process by which people decide to seek help for their drug\u00a0use and how families can support these decisions.\n  TOPIC 2: STRATEGIES\nBreakThrough isn\u2019t just about ice. We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.  Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.\n TOPIC 3: HELP\nThe last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones. We also look at some of the barriers to seeking help and how to overcome these.  All family members attending the workshop will be given information on where to get help and\u00a0support following the completion of the workshop and options for ongoing support activities.",

In this first part of the session we separate fact from fiction. We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.<BR> <BR> Most importantly, we explain the process by which people decide to seek help for their drug\u00a0use and how families can support these decisions.</SPAN></P>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN> <BR> TOPIC 2: STRATEGIES</SPAN></H2>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>BreakThrough isn\u2019t just about ice. We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.<BR> <BR> Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.</SPAN></P>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN><BR> TOPIC 3: HELP</SPAN></H2>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>The last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones. We also look at some of the barriers to seeking help and how to overcome these.<BR> <BR> All family members attending the workshop will be given information on where to get help and\u00a0support following the completion of the workshop and options for ongoing support activities.</SPAN></P>"
