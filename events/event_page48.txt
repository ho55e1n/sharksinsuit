                "text": "Hi there,\nWould you like to improve the relationship with your dog? Or are you a dog professional, a vet, or working in the animal industry, and would like to know more about how human behaviour, thoughts and emotions impact our dogs and influence their behaviour, and how you can support the dog owner during your service? \nIf yes, then attending the 2-day \u201cBravery Workshop\u201d would bring great value to your life. The goal of the workshop is that by the end of the 2 days you will have inner resources that you can draw upon for the rest of your life. This isn\u2019t a \u201ctraditional\u201d dog-training course. This revolutionary course focuses on \u201cthe end of the lead\u201d (aka the dog owner) and less on the dog.\nSo what will \"THE BRAVERY WORKSHOP\" cover?\nThis 2-day workshop is designed for dog owners, dog trainers, vets, and other people working in the animal industry, who want to learn more about how to troubleshoot common problems with the human at the end of the lead.\nTopics covered in the workshop:\n\n\nYou will learn about the evolution, the keystones and the practical implications of \"THE PACT MODEL\",\u00a0which is the theoretical foundation of the workshop and has been especially designed for the human at the end of the lead\n\n\nYou will learn about unhelpful behaviours and thought processes that frequently interfere and stop the human-dog couple from having a good relationship\n\n\nYou will practice grounding and self-soothing strategies, to set yourself up for success in your training and difficult life circumstances in general\n\n\nYou will learn how to cultivate \u201cemotional flexibility\u201d that helps you create a sense of \"BRAVERY\" and resilience in your every day life. Hopefully you will learn a lot more about self-care and \"emotional wealth\".\u00a0\n\n\nYou will learn to read human stress signals, and the best strategies that can help humans calm down the quickest\u2028without passing their stress onto their dog\n\n\nYou will learn about the concept of \u201cemotional transmissions\u201d that we pass onto our dogs, often without knowing or being aware of them\n\n\nYou will be shown strategies how to increase your confidence and self-esteem whilst interacting with your dog\n\n\nThe workshop will be hands on and it is designed to address common problems that dog owners face in everyday life\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have any prerequisites to attend this course, the only thing you need is an open mind that is curious and would like to grow. ;)\nWho is hosting this workshop?\nMy name is Birdy O\u2019Sheedy, I\u2019m a ccoach and professional dog nerd, and have a true passion for helping dog owners. I\u2019m a qualified dog trainer and have a degree in clinical psychology. I mainly work with the human at the end of the leash as this is what is often needed the most. You see, I\u2019ve struggled with my dog Luna too. To be honest, we had some very difficult times. We had to go through a lengthy behaviour modification program, and let\u2019s face it, it wasn't always an easy ride.\u00a0I was very lucky as I had access to amazing dog trainers who always had my back, and never gave up on us. After a while I realized that the behaviour modification program was not just addressing the dog\u2026 it was mainly addressing me. And despite realizing this, I still struggled. I love a good challenge, so I put my \u201cprofessional hat\u201d on and researched tools that could help my dog and me better. So over time I discovered certain psychological techniques that helped to speed up training, which proved to be very effective as they are evidence-based and stem from well-researched psychological interventions.\u00a0\u00a0As I want to pass on my knowledge that I've gained from this experience, I founded Paws In Life Coaching in addition to my psychology practice Pause In Life Psychology. My mission is to help other dog owners enjoy their relationship with their dog more and show professionals how they can set the dog owner up for success, and not just focus on the dog. \nI'm a big fan of evidence-based methods and have trained globally in quite a few methods as a clinical psychologist, and love attending workshops about anything dog related.\nIf you have questions, please contact me through my webpage \u00a0or through Eventbrite. Ticket cost is $388.06 (including GST and Eventbrite service fee).\u00a0\nGeneral information about the workshop:\n\n\nPlease note that you don't need to bring your dog along for this workshop. Humans only. :)\n\n\nThe event will be held at PRO DOG Training\u00a0and we are really grateful that David McKelson is letting us use his awesome facility.\u00a0\n\n\nThe event will be fully catered for but if you have strict dietary requirements (e.g. celiac, vegan), please bring your own food, though there will be vegetarian options. It might be handy to have your own water bottle though. \n\n\nPlease bring a dog leash (I know this might not make sense, as there won\u2019t be any dogs\u2026 but we will need it anyway. You\u2019ll just have to wait and see! :)\u00a0\n\n\nPens and learning material will be provided. \n\n\nIf you have been to a BRAVERY workshop in the past, please come along, as this year\u2019s concept is very different to last year\u2019s workshop.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that registration will start at 8:30am on Saturday and the workshop will begin at 9am sharp on both days. We are aiming to finish on both days around 4:30pm.\n\n\n\n\nAlso check us out on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to stay up to date and get the latest news!\n\n\nWe would love to see you and your friends there. So make sure to book today, as there are limited spots available!\nHave a great day,\nBirdy",

                "text": "\r\n\r\nDear Women of Melbourne,\r\n\r\nWould you like to know the Secret to Women\u2019s Self-Defence training\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026that will allow you to skill-up, quick-smart\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026even if you\u2019ve NEVER done any martial arts or self-defence before?\u00a0\r\n\r\nI thought so.\r\n Let me explain...\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nEver walking down the street late at night...\u00a0\r\n\r\nNot sure if you\u2019re imagining those footsteps behind you?\u00a0\r\n\r\nAre they real?\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo you ever wonder whether you\u2019re being followed?\u00a0\r\n\r\nHave you jumped into an Uber or taxi with a friend...\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven though you don\u2019t live anywhere near each other...\u00a0\r\n\r\nDid you ever leave a party late at night...\u00a0\r\n\r\n...and your friends offer to walk you to your car...\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut you don\u2019t want to trouble them...\u00a0\r\n\r\n...or seem too needy, too dependent...or too paranoid...\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou decline their offer.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ve been there too...\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOver the past 25 years, I have helped over 1,500 women from all walks of life\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026learn the Self-Defence strategies, tactics and techniques they need\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026to protect themselves\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026and their loved ones\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026so they can live the life they want.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur Women\u2019s Self-Defence Programs are unique\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026carefully curated and designed for women, by women\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026to address the specific fears, doubts and concerns that women have about their personal safety.\r\n\r\nOur all-women team of instructors and crew understand all too well\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026the sorts of dangers that women face today.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nI have worked with hundreds of women who have been victims of violent crime\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026women who know very well the threats that exist in our world\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026women who believe that in an ideal world\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026we shouldn\u2019t need Self-Defence\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026but understand that the REAL world\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026is far from ideal\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026women who are ready to take control of their own lives\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026women who recognise the very real need for serious Self-Defence education and training in their own lives...\u00a0\r\n\r\n...and made it a priority to learn as much as they could...\u00a0\r\n\r\n...in the shortest time possible\u2026\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS STORIES\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to share with you\u2026some success stories from a few our students\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026to give you an idea of what is possible\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026in a very short space of time\u2026\r\n\r\n~ Amelia\u2019s Story ~\r\n\r\nAmelia was out partying late at night with some friends\u2026\r\n\r\nThey had left the nightclub and were walking out on the street.\r\n\r\nHer friends had walked up ahead of her\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026soon she noticed that a guy had begun following her\u2026\r\n\r\nHe was trying to talk to her.\r\n\r\nShe wasn\u2019t interested\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and so she ignored him.\r\n\r\nEventually, he got sick of being ignored\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd he suddenly grabbed her from behind.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking, Amelia\u2019s training kicked in instantly.\r\n\r\nShe grounded herself and lowered her centre of gravity into a \u2018stance\u2019\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026then threw a back elbow at the guy\u2019s face!\r\n\r\nHe let go immediately\u2026\r\n\r\nAmelia gave him a blood nose\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026and he also began to cry\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\nA male bystander came up to them and began to tell the guy off\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026a little too late, according to Amelia\u2026\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise was\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026the guy ended up apologising to Amelia.\r\n\r\nShe was very proud of herself for not freezing in the moment\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and being able to free herself from the guy\u2019s grip and control\u2026\r\n\r\nShe hopes he has learnt his lesson\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and never does this to another woman again.\r\n\r\n~ Katherine\u2019s Story\u00a0~\r\n\r\nKatherine was out for a night of partying with her friends.\r\n\r\nShe had to leave early that night\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and as she was saying goodbye to her friends\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026they offered to walk her to her car\u2026\r\n\r\nAs her car was just a short distance away\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026just around the corner\u2026\r\n\r\nShe did not take up their offer to walk her to her car.\r\n\r\nLittle did she know\u2026\r\n\r\nDanger was lurking just around the corner\u2026\r\n\r\nAs she approached her car\u2026\r\n\r\nShe was attacked by a man.\r\n\r\nShe remembers thinking he wanted to mug her\u2026\r\n\r\nAs she reached for her wallet to hand over to him\u2026\r\n\r\nHe launched his assault on her.\r\n\r\nKatherine remembers being surprised that she was able to hold her stance\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026even in high heels\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnd in hindsight, she was even more surprised that she was able to instantly cover up against her attacker\u2019s strikes\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and throw a left hook\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026that broke his nose\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026and made him stumble back.\r\n\r\nThe attacker ran off as she screamed at the top of her lungs.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there were police patrolling nearby that night\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnd they were able to find and arrest the attacker.\r\n\r\nKatherine is grateful for her training\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026which kicked in instantly\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026when she needed it most.\r\n\r\nShe says in a recent interview, that her training with us\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026saved her life.\u00a0\r\n\r\nShe also credits her training with building up her confidence\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026so she could ace job interviews\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and excel in her career as a social worker.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the incident\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026Katherine had done less than a handful of sessions over a 2-week period\u2026\r\n\r\nAmelie and Katherine had NO previous martial arts or self-defence training.\r\n\r\nThey both believe so firmly in the power of our Survival-Based Self-Defence training\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026and the power of the skills, knowledge and experience they have gained\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026that they still attend and assist with many of our Women\u2019s Self-Defence Programs today\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026so you might meet them at one our of events in the future!\r\n\r\nAmelia and Katherine are just a couple of our success stories.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many, many more women who have benefitted immensely from training with us.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWANT TO LEARN MORE?\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like me to help YOU get these same results\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2026that you can apply straight away, in your everyday life\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026then join us for our \u2018Women\u2019s Self-Defence Essentials\u2019 Workshop in Melbourne!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s going to be held on Saturday 4 May 2019.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll meet at 9am for registration.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop will run from 9:30am to 11:30am\u2026\r\n\r\nAt this Workshop, you will learn:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ONE defence EVERY woman should know\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to defend against an attack from behind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to overcome your fears and the \u2018freeze\u2019 response\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to kick-start your \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use your voice as a weapon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ONE thing you must pay attention to, and not ignore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd much, much more\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nThen after the Workshop, we\u2019ll have morning tea\u00a0& refreshments\u2026 (Yay! Food!)\r\n\r\n\u2026including muffins, danishes, sandwiches, fresh fruit, and DIY yogurt parfaits along with tea and coffee (menu may be subject to minor changes)\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrom my 25+ years of experience, teaching Women\u2019s Self-Defence\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026I have found that many women have great questions they would like to ask AFTER a Workshop\u2026\r\n\r\nOur Workshop is jam-packed with
