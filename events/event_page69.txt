                "text": "Opening night:6-8pm Wednesday, 8 May Open from: 9 May - 1 June (this runs past May 22!)---------------------------E2: A Commentary on Productivity (ACOP) is a mixed-media group show by Kirsty McKellar in conjunction with Ladder Art Space. ACOP hopes to create a collective voice on the meaning of being productive in a contemporary context. It beckons artists and audience members to reflect on what productivity is: is it important in day-to-day life? Is it self-driven, and/or is it something (positive/neutral/negative) they feel society requires of them? As part of initiative olis, ACOP brings together local and international talents, both established in their careers and emerging, from a variety of practical and formal fine art and creative backgrounds.Exhibition Two (E2) exists as the second and final instalment of this series, the first taking place in Berlin last year. For Exhibition One (E1) artists were asked to create an experimental, blueprint or prototype artwork, with an emphasis being placed on the artistic process over the final product. E1 was held in the former VEB Berliner Metallh\u00fctten und Halbzeugwerke building complex in Sch\u00f6neweide, Berlin for an informal showcasing. Experimentation and creation at the vacant former metalwork factory allowed artists to express themselves and their ideas in a low-pressure environment (without a formal audience), providing them the space and time in their artistic practice to assemble their ideas. Now the artists join me again at Ladder Art Space, showcasing their final works from the fourteen-month long project.

ACOP hopes to create a collective voice on the meaning of being productive in a contemporary context. It beckons artists and audience members to reflect on what productivity is: is it important in day-to-day life? Is it self-driven, and/or is it something (positive/neutral/negative) they feel society requires of them? As part of initiative olis, ACOP brings together local and international talents, both established in their careers and emerging, from a variety of practical and formal fine art and creative backgrounds.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>Exhibition Two (E2) exists as the second and final instalment of this series, the first taking place in Berlin last year. For Exhibition One (E1) artists were asked to create an experimental, blueprint or prototype artwork, with an emphasis being placed on the artistic process over the final product. E1 was held in the former VEB Berliner Metallh\u00fctten und Halbzeugwerke building complex in Sch\u00f6neweide, Berlin for an informal showcasing. Experimentation and creation at the vacant former metalwork factory allowed artists to express themselves and their ideas in a low-pressure environment (without a formal audience), providing them the space and time in their artistic practice to assemble their ideas.

Christina has run a weekly podcast for years now, so she really knows her stuff, and I wanted to learn from an expert I could trust. The course was fantastic. Heaps of valuable information, and insider tips to make podcasting fast and\u00a0easy. The session on editing was super valuable because the free software isn't intuitive; you need instructions. Christina and Aaron provided great support materials, and a warm, friendly, professional environment to learn. Can't wait to launch my podcast. It is called Kath in the City.\"\u00a0\r\n- Kath Walters, KathWalters.com\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"The workshop was really great. Enjoyed it. Good sized class and the tuition was informed and open.

We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.

We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.  Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.\n TOPIC 3: HELP\nThe last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones.

This is contributing to and being intensified by climate change. Consequently, transformation of land use and food consumption are important dimensions of a response to climate change. Australian scientific skills in biology and botany can secure the Australian transformation and extend it internationally.\nThis lecture discusses the opportunity for sequestration of carbon in Australian soils, pastures, woodlands and savannahs, and forests. It overviews the history of land-use sequestration policy since the Climate Change Review to the Federal and all State and Territory Governments (Cambridge University Press, 2008).
