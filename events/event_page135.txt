                "text": "\n\nHave fun creating your very own masterpiece painting with acrylic on a 40x50cm canvas without ever having painted before!\nOur artists paint along with you demonstrating step-by-step from start-to-end how to paint the featured artwork while you enjoy the relaxing experience, sipping on a glass of your favourite beverage and socialising with friends.\nIts all about\u00a0Fun\u00a0Art, not\u00a0Fine\u00a0Art!\nAnd remember, we are a BYO studio,\u00a0so bring along your favourite bottle or two of liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint and sip with us on the day.\nYou supply the wine and we\u2019ll provide all the art materials, glassware and good vibes. Leave the rest to us!\nThis is not your typical painting class!\u00a0\n\nFAQs\n1. What time should I arrive to my session?\nFor our evening sessions, our studio doors open at 6.40pm and painting starts sharply at 7pm. For our Sunday afternoon sessions, our studio doors open at 1.40pm and painting starts sharply at 2pm. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your session's start time and check in with our artists, pour your wine, greet your fellow paint and sippers and get your paint colours.\n\n2. What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nOur Address:\u00a0Our South Melbourne studio is located at 206 Clarendon Street, South Melbourne, Victoria 3205, on the corner of Clarendon Street and York Street.\nPublic Parking:\u00a0Public parking is available on both streets but note, parking metre fees apply at some locations during the day. Also available are the Woolworth and Aldi public parking garages located on York Street, about 50m from our studio.\nPublic Transport:\u00a0If you\u2019re catching public transport, Tram Route 12 brings you by our studio doors. Tram Stop 127 (heading into the CBD) is located in front of our studio.\n\n3. What can I bring into the event?\nWe are a BYO Studio. So, bring along your favourite liquid creativity to enjoy while you paint! A glass of wine or two helps bring out your inner artist. Also, you are welcome to bring along snacks and nibbles.\n\n4. Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nYou must be 18+ to attend a night session. Children aged 9+ are welcome to Sunday day sessions with an accompanying painting adult, no exception. As our sessions are intended to be relaxing for all our patrons, due to the duration of our sessions, children under the age of 9 are not permitted to attend.\n\n5.

Simply mark down whom you would be interested in connecting with again on your NetworkNite 'Connect-Card' and we'll take care of the rest. You also always have the option of exchanging business cards should you feel so inclined. For those whom garner connections, you will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the event with your 'Connect-Card' results.\u00a0Once the Speed Networking has completed and all participants have had the opportunity to meet each other - you are welcome to stay and mingle. All we need are the 'Connect-Cards' to determine your business connections.</P>"

With less than 30 days to the event, tickets are non-refundable, but are transferable - see below.\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?No, we keep a record of all attendees, so you do not require your ticket on the day.\nCan I update my registration information?Yes. If you need to update any information, simply send an email to info@nextparadigm.com.au with your Order Number and changes you'd like to make.\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?Your ticket is transferable to anyone else in your organisation, up to 48 hours before the workshop. If you would like to transfer your ticket, please send details of the transferee with your Order Number to info@nextparadigm.com.au.\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\"The Agile for Leaders workshop was a valuable source of practical information for applying Agile to everyday tasks. Next Paradigm delivered an informative, jargon-free session which was accessible to all regardless of their background in the organisation.\"\nNathan Price,\u00a0Director (a/g) eServices, Administrative Appeals Tribunal\n\n\u201cAs an experienced PM and BA, I thought the course was pitched at just the right level. Having said that, others in my course did not have my experience, yet seemed to understand the content just as well. We covered a lot in one day and we went right to 5 pm, unlike many courses I have taken.\nEric provided a good mix of PowerPoint, videos and teamwork, based on real examples and games, to keep us engaged and to really get the message across. Eric has a wealth of experience in this area so was able to answer questions with real-life examples.\nI recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about agile in projects.\u201d\nDesir\u00e9e Heather, Deputy Chief Information Officer,\u00a0Australian Public Service Commission\n\n",

The reforms are described in brief below:\n\u00a0The MARAM Framework is the updated Common Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) and it underpins both FVISS and the CISS reforms.

The aim is for proactive, early sharing of any information to improve the wellbeing of children. This means that we no longer share information only when a child is at risk.
