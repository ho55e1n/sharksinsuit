Using both plenary and group activities, we expect you to leave the workshop with a better understanding of what supervision of peers and colleagues means and the different models of peer/colleague supervision. You will discuss effective supervision and its outcomes, alongside barriers and enablers to effective supervision of peers/colleagues. You will also explore ways to evaluate supervision of learners in your own health or human services contexts. The focus of this workshop will be on the restorative (supportive) functions of supervision and will cover the principles of self-care, supervisors supporting supervisees, and supportive workplace cultures. We also draw on examples of supervising peers/colleagues interacting with clients under challenging circumstances such as those affected by methamphetamine.\nVenue:\nLevel 3, seminar room 2\n\u00a0",

Come up with a bunch of ideas and pick the one you want to work on for the rest of the hackathon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDeveloping:\u00a0We'll leave lots of time for you to develop your ideas, build a prototype if possible, and prepare your presentation.\u00a0\n\n\nPresenting:\u00a0Each team will present to a panel of judges, who will pick the winning teams.\u00a0\n\n\nCelebrating:\u00a0Unwind and celebrate what you've achieved in less than 24hrs over a drink and something to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiming\n\nFriday\n\n\n5:30pm: Arrive, have something to drink and eat, and start to get to know your fellow participants\n\n\n6:00pm: Presentations to provide inspiration, resources and information on what the next 24 hours will entail\n\n\n7:30pm: Dinner, team formation, and team registration\n\n\n8:30pm: Go home and rest (or work if you really want to)\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\n8:00am: Doors open and breakfast served\n\n\nWork in your teams with help from some mentors\n\n\n12:30pm: Lunch served\n\n\nOptional presentation practice\n\n\n4:45pm: Submissions due\n\n\n5:00pm: 5-minute presentation by each team followed by questions from the judges\n\n\n6:00pm: Drinks to celebrate all you've achieved in 24 hours with winners announced by 7:00pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently asks questions (FAQs)\n\nHow many people are allowed in a team?\nTeams must contain 2, 3 or 4 people. Teams with 5 or more people in them must break into two or more smaller teams. Individuals can't compete but we will help you find at least one other person to form a team with (see below).\n\nI already have teammates, can I just participate with them?\nYes! As long as you have at least one other person on your team (and your team doesn't have more than four people in it).\n\nI don't know anyone else attending, how will I form a team?\u00a0\nWe have your back! We have built in a number of ways for you to meet other people in the same boat and will help you form a team with people you want to spend Saturday with. Friday night will start off with some casual networking over drinks. During the presentations, everyone will introduce themselves so you know who else is looking for team members. During dinner, the organiser will help match individuals together and make sure no one is left out. If you have any questions or concerns please send an email to events@energylab.org.au.\n\nCan I still participate if I don't have an idea?\nYou can! We'll help your team find something interesting to work on.\u00a0\n\nDo I have to spend the entire time at the venue?\nNope, but we would encourage you to. It's a great venue and we'll provide a constant stream of food and drink. However, if you would be more comfortable elsewhere or have other commitments then you're free to come and go. Please just be back in time for the presentations on Saturday.\n\nWho typically attends hackathons?\nEnergyLab's hackathons attract a more diverse audience than most. While some hackathons cater to a younger crowd, we are careful to make sure our hackathons are welcoming to adults of all ages. We typically have a good mix of university students, young professionals and professionals with 10-20 years of experience up their sleeve. As long as you're at least 18 years old, you should feel welcome at our hackathons.\u00a0\n\nI have another question, who can I talk to?\u00a0\nSend us an email at events@energylab.org.au.\n\n\n\n\nAbout EnergyLab\n\nEnergyLab is Australia\u2019s leading platform for launching new energy businesses. Our integrated approach draws on the community of clean energy entrepreneurs and offers a range of ways to engage and leverage their ideas, technologies and resources. To read more about EnergyLab head to energylab.org.au.\n\n\n\n\nWant more?\n\nThis hackathon follows EnergyLab's three-part series on trends in clean energy. For inspiration on start-up ideas you may be intersted in attending one or all of our panel discussion events, of which more information can be found below:\n\n\nEnergyLab Canberra: Trends in Energy Generation\n\n\nEnergyLab Canberra: Trends in Energy Storage & Smart Grids\n\n\nEnergyLab Canberra: Trends in Energy Consumption\n\n\nIf you would like to receive invitations to other events EnergyLab organises in the future, please\u00a0sign up to our mailing list.\u00a0\u00a0",

In addition, they are taking fellow Wild Thing Ballarat prog-punk sensation Ebonivory along for the ride. With each band\u2019s recent performances at PROGFEST 2019 completely breathtaking, and with Circles' live show one of the most powerful and mind blowing going around, this is a tour you definitely do not want to miss! \nThe tour lands in New Zealand first, where Auckland\u2019s post-alternative rock kings\u00a0City Of Souls\u00a0will headline shows in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch, then returns to Australia for\u00a0Circles\u2019 headline shows in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Belgrave, and Ballarat.\n2018 was a watershed year for\u00a0Circles, releasing their masterpiece album\u00a0The Last One\u00a0through\u00a0Wild Thing Records\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand and\u00a0Season Of Mist\u00a0internationally.\u00a0Louder\u00a0said that The Last One was \"...very much in a similar fashion to countrymen Karnivool, Circles have crafted a modern progressive tapestry with plenty of wider appeal thanks to songwriting nous coupled with their apparent technicality.\" They then joined\u00a0TesseracT\u00a0on their\u00a0Australian Tour in September\u00a0as special guests. Soon after, Circles jetted off on their momentous return to Europe, touring across the continent with fellow Australian progressive rock trailblazers\u00a0Caligula\u2019s Horse\u00a0between October-November, while also appearing at prominent festivals\u00a0ProgPower Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Euroblast.

The setting offers extensive possibilities for teachers to engage in authentic inquiry using the rich and diverse resources on site and in the local area.

They will plan their inquiry process by identifying resources, engaging with the context of the school and the local community.

                "text": "Workshop Descriptor:\nThis workshop will focus on how to effectively plan, teach and assess for conceptual learning. As many curriculums are moving to more of a conceptual framework, it is important that this translated into classroom practice.\n\u2018Trying to teach in the 21st\u00a0century without conceptual schema for knowledge is like trying to build a house without a blueprint.\u2019\u00a0Lynn H Erickson\nIn this workshop teachers will have the opportunity to develop their understanding of the role of concepts in curriculum design and teaching. This will be enhanced through the opportunity to go through the stages of planning a unit of work with a focus on concepts.\nThis workshop will unpack many of the ideas and models presented in \u2018Taking the Complexity Out of Concepts\u2019 a book that has been published by Hawker Brownlow in Australia.\nParticipants will:\n\n\nUnderstand the importance of why to teach conceptually\n\n\nUnpack the difference between a conceptual framework and a topic based\u00a0framework.\n\n\nUse the Innovative Global Education model for developing understanding goals\u00a0and conceptual understandings (central ideas, statements of inquiry, big ideas, enduring understandings)\n\n\nUse the Innovative Global Education model for developing rubrics of\u00a0understanding that assist in moderating and assessing understanding goals.\n\n\nDevelop appropriate summative assessment tasks that assess the understanding\u00a0goals and therefore, the conceptual understanding.\n\n\nUnderstand the importance of connecting students to concepts.\n\n\nUnderstand and plan formative assessment connected to students' understanding of\u00a0concepts driving the unit.\n\n\nDevelop learning engagements that are significant and connected to the\u00a0understanding goals. \u00a0\n\n\nPlan a unit of work with a focus on conceptual teaching, learning and assessing.\n\n\nBuild a repertoire of teaching strategies focused on conceptual teaching and\u00a0learning.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop will be suitable for teachers and leaders that are using or moving to a conceptual framework for planning, teaching and assessing. This includes classroom teachers, single subject teachers or coordinators teaching from Year 1 to Year 7.\nIt is suggested that, where possible, people attend this workshop as a collaobrative group (2 or more), so that throughout the planning process there are opportunites to collaborate and discuss ideas with someone else planning the same unit.\nWhat to bring:\nParticipants will need to bring a unit they wish to develop a conceptual overview for and plan for conceptually.\u00a0\nWorkshop Leader Biography:\nTania LATTANZIO is an experienced international educator. Previously a teacher, coordinator, and manager with the International Baccalaureate, she is now Regional Director of Innovative Global Education. In this role she works as a consultant extensively in Asia Pacific and other parts of the world. This role involves developing and conducting professional development for teachers and leadership, modelling pedagogy in classrooms, developing and designing curriculum for schools and working intensively with teaching teams, through mentoring and coaching, to improve planning, teaching and assessment. \u00a0A passionate educator Tania works closely with educational institutions to specifically meet their needs in supporting school reform, making significant shifts in pedagogy and curriculum in both local and international settings.

Although individual primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are rare, collectively they are becoming increasingly prevalent and an important cause of chronic disease. With more than 350 inborn errors of immunity described to date and new primary immune disorders continuingly being recognised, it is important to regularly inform the paediatrician about these conditions to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate management of these patients.\u00a0\nThe 2019 PID Update will focus on Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of PID, often described as a paediatric emergency.
