This introductory session will give an overview of what STEM education is, why it is important and how thinking and working across the STEM disciplines can help our students to be engaged in authentic and rigorous real world problems.\nKEEPING IT REAL! (PRIMARY)\nAisha Kristiansen - Christ the King Primary School\nSTEM offers a world of opportunities, but where do you start! \u00a0How do you create units of work that not only have strong ties to real world problem solving, but also meet the requirements of the Victorian Curriculum. \u00a0Find out how to transform learning by empowering students to make a difference in the world.\nSTEM THROUGH PLAY (PRIMARY)\nMichelle Dennis - Strathcona Baptist Girls Grammar School\nThe Nintendo Labo Schools program gives younger primary students an entry into STEM learning. \u00a0Students make, play and discover the intricacies of technology as they design their own solutions. \u00a0Find out how Strathcona to use this program as part of an integrated unit on living creatures and brought the students\u2019 imagination to life.\nAUTHENTIC STEM EDUCATION (PRIMARY)\nGeorge Spiridis - Berwick Lodge Primary School,\u00a0Mount Martha Primary\nA \"Structure\" on how to implement an integrated \"Authentic STEM Education\", that is tailored for all year levels (without gender bias), in \"Single Subject Areas\" addressing curriculum or dedicated \"STEM Areas\" addressing curriculum. How to use a \"Making Environment\" to engage students towards a greater understanding of: The integration of each discipline of \"STEM\" and their relationship in working together for an \"Authentic STEM Outcome\". The Concepts and Principles of Technology and Engineering. The resources and platforms for a functioning outcome in STEM.\nSTEAM CITY (SECONDARY)\nMiriam Beasy - MLC Kew\nThe Year 7 STEAM City saw students and staff (from all disciplines) work collaboratively to create a model of a city, and consider the essential question of \u201cHow do we make our part of the city as liveable as possible?\u201d How do you design a project that is collaborative? How do you get buy in from other teachers? How do you bring together staff from all disciplines and not just those that are traditionally represented by the \u201cSTEAM/STEM\u201d title? What are some of the planning considerations- skills, timetabling, structure of the day etc?\nA CASE STUDY FOR SCHOOL-WIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITECH AND STEM IN YEARS 7-9 (SECONDARY)\nKaylene Morter - Yarram Secondary College\nTo introduce digi tech in a format that can be assessed, YSC is trialling a week long immersion for students and teachers. Students will take part in lessons that teach skills related to digi tech and then use this knowledge to \u00a0create a digital /STEM related group project. Topics covered include areas such as algorithmic thinking and circuits. Projects offered are from different learning domains and include an electronic band and light/sound filled artwork and fashion. Teachers will be upskilled in one particular area so they can be part of the teaching and learning for the week. Lessons and projects will be linked to the digital curriculum for reporting purposes.\nSTEM, THE UN AND THE SCIENCE CLASSROOM (SECONDARY)\nKim Bruce - Alia College\nEngaging high schoolers in Science can be tough - where are they going to use this stuff \u2018in real life\u2019? Student-led activism is gaining momentum and this got me wondering how I could empower my students to take action and feel confident in their actions. Bringing the real world into the lab was a good idea - but how? This is how I used the UN Goals and the principles of STEM to help my students feel like they could make a difference.",

Wabi Sabi, the captivating concept from Japanese aesthetics, is a refreshing antidote to our fast-paced, precision-seeking, consumption-driven world.\r\n\r\nIn\u00a0Wabi Sabi, everything is made more beautiful\u00a0by baring the marks and scars of age and individuality.\u00a0Repairs and reconstructions are to be appreciated\u00a0rather than made invisible.\u00a0Peace can be found by embracing\u00a0the transitory, incomplete and impermanent\u00a0nature of existence.\u00a0Perhaps if we embraced a little Wabi Sabi in our work,\u00a0we might find greater satisfaction in simple\u00a0moments.\u00a0More enjoyment in everyday interactions.\u00a0More reverence for the often unheroic essence\u00a0of our professional lives.\r\n\r\nAs part of the global event series, \u2018The Chamber of Beautiful Business\u2019, you\u2019re invited to join a revolutionary cast of business & cultural leaders to shape a more empowering philosophy for work. As you wine and dine you\u2019ll converse and create with artists, executives, entrepreneurs, scientists & philosophers on how to find and define a new operating system for 21st-Century business. \u2028\r\n\r\nTogether we\u2019ll\u00a0turn the mundane into the mysterious,\u00a0find fortune in fleeting experience,\u00a0and savour the inevitable mess\u00a0of building a beautiful business.\r\n\r\nProudly supported by Death Gin & The Catalyst Network.\r\nAll proceeds going to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre\r\n____\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout the Chambers of Beautiful Business\r\nA series of daytime and evening gatherings in select cities all around the globe, the Chambers are part of the\u00a0House of Beautiful Business, a global think tank and community founded to explore the human future of work. \r\nAt its annual gathering in Lisbon, the House brings together a select group of 300 business and nonprofit leaders, founders, technologists, investors, designers, artists, and scientists to explore how to make business more beautiful, specifically how to lead with purpose and passion, build human companies and workplaces, and design for deeper connections in an age of machines. If you\u2019re interested in participating,\u00a0request an invitation here.\r\nDedicated to amplifying its mission throughout local communities, the series of Chambers are co-hosted by House Residents.\u00a0Find out more\u00a0about upcoming editions in\u00a0Amsterdam, Athens, Belgrade, Berlin, Cape Town, Detroit, Hamburg, Istanbul, London, Madrid, Melbourne, Milan, New York City, Vancouver, and Warsaw.\r\nMore questions?\r\nFeel free to reach out to:Monika Jiangmonika@thebusinessromanticsociety.comCell: +49 1590 1222 787www.thebusinessromanticsociety.com\r\nMykel Dixonmykel@mykeldixon.comPh: +61 434 873 232www.mykeldixon.com\r\nProduced by The Business Romantic Societyin association with Mykel Dixon Pty Ltd\r\n\u00a0\r\n____\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut wait?\r\nSo who is speaking?\r\nWhat value will I get from this experience?\r\nHow will I apply this to my work and life?\r\nFear not.\r\nWe have a full line-up of savvy, entrepreneurial savants, business artisans and cultural architects. All with impressive credentials, eclectic & enigmatic stories and tailor-made content, specifically designed for this event. But we want you to come for the intent.

Eventbrite's privacy policy can be found at the privacy link located at the bottom of this page.\nIndividuals can also choose to book directly with Darebin Intercultural Centre by contacting 8470 8440 or emailing intercultural@darebin.vic.gov.au.\u00a0\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhat is No Lights No Lycra?\nNo Lights No Lycra (NLNL) is a dance community that started in Melbourne.\u00a0NLNL is a lights-off chance to dance in the dark for the pure joy of dancing. It occurs in over 75 locations around the world...and in partnership with the NLNL Melbourne team, the Intercultural Centre is bringing it to Preston!\nWhat kind of music is it?\nAt this special event, the playlist is based on the diverse languages of Darebin. It will involve a bit of everything - anything from\u00a0swing, to dance, to pop, to folk, to rock, to hip hop, to soul, to super cheesy top 40. You can always sit out for a song or step-tap on the spot if anything doesn't take your fancy - it's not like anyone will see you!\nHow dark is it?\nIt's light enough so that you can see the silhouettes of people around you, but dark enough so that you can't make out their features. We aim for a sweet spot between creating a judgement-free space and safety! When the lights first go out, it will seem pitch black, but after a few minutes your eyes will adjust and you can find your space to bust a move.\nIt sounds like it could be creepy? Is it creepy?\nNLNL is a drug and alcohol free zone and is all about safe and respectful behaviour. While it is dark, NLNL is for dancing on your own, so people dance independently and it's completely non-contact - there isn't any direct physical interaction between people.\nDo people go on their own?\nHeaps of people do! It\u2019s up to you if you come with friends or not. Regardless, once the music starts everyone finds room on the dance floor to dance independently. Attending alone is totally normal, welcome and even encouraged! We ask that people under 18 bring along an adult guardian.\u00a0\nWhat should I wear?\nWhatever you feel comfortable to dance in - tracksuit or yoga pants, bike shorts, office attire etc. You can dance barefoot, with socks or in shoes.\u00a0\nDo people talk?\nOnce the lights go out and the music starts, NLNL is a strictly talk-free zone. This might seem strange but it's really important for getting lost in the music and the movement of your body.\nCan we use our phones during the event?\nNope! Phone screens are really bright and it disturbs the magic of the darkness for everyone else. So make sure your phone is hidden away where we can't see it. We aim to start on time and not go past 8.15pm so you don't need to check the time.\u00a0\nWho goes to NLNL?\nThere is generally a mix of ages, genders, bodies, abilities, backgrounds and dance styles. This is a safe space for everyone, including the LGBTQI community, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and people with disabilities. If you want to be there, then you belong!",

                "text": "\nA seven week chakra course\n\nWould you like to understand yourself better? Would you like to be more aware of your own thoughts, emotions, habits and behaviours? Would you like to create your life rather than feeling like life just happens to you?\u00a0\n\nYour body, emotions and thoughts are all connected. Discerning what\u2019s happening within these elements is fundamental to health and wellness, success and fulfilment. What is your body trying to tell you when you feel pain or discomfort? What particular emotions and thoughts are beneath this discomfort? For example, if you hold tension or feel pain between your shoulder blades \u2014 what frustration, resentment or anger are you holding onto? Do you often feel switched on and are looking to learn how to switch off and love life more?\n\nAutumn\u00a0is here and with it comes the energy of\u00a0letting go of what no longer serves you, just like the trees that lose their leaves. It's now time to work with your internal world.\u00a0Getting the most out of life requires you to align your\u00a0intention\u00a0with your\u00a0energy. One of the most powerful mind-body medicine tools for growth is the ancient system of energy called \u2018the chakras\u2019.Getting the most out of life requires you to align your intention with your energy. One of the most powerful tools to do this is through an ancient system of energy called \u2018the chakras\u2019. \u00a0\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn\nTo harness the powerful energy of growth, our kinesiologist and complementary medicine practitioner, Kate Pamphilon is running a seven week course: \u2018Align & shine\u2019. Each week, Kate will guide you through one of the seven major chakras as you explore the different elements of mind, body and soul. Each week you\u2019ll learn about a major chakra and its relationship to:\n\n\nphysical tendencies: your anatomy and physiology\u00a0\ncommon emotions and thought patterns\nconcepts associated with the soul and meaning in life\nexploring eras of your life, seven years at a time\nprofound (and fun!) tools and techniques for healing, clearing and enhancing your energy system.\u00a0\n\n\nAlign & Shine will teach you conscious living \u2014 choosing to longer be a passenger to your life but to be in the driver's seat. It\u2019s about being able to say: \u201cI know what I want and I choose to take my life with both hands and embrace it\u201d. It\u2019s time to stop living unconsciously by allowing your old, unconscious behaviours to run the show. Every choice has a consequence; even not choosing has a consequence. Rather than throwing your hands up in the air with frustration, bring your awareness to your internal workings. In doing so, you\u2019ll learn so much about yourself and it will begin to make sense. As you awaken to yourself, you will know your next steps. And most of all, you\u2019ll have clarity, guidance and self-love. What more could you want?\u00a0\n\nChakra Energy\nIn everyday life, you\u2019re constantly receiving feedback from your: body, mind, emotions and environment. Flowing at the very core of this human experience is your energy system that, like a web or vibration, connects all of these aspects. Quantum physics has shown us that we are electromagnetic beings - literally spinning particles of light. The ancient knowledge of the chakras have always understood this. In fact, chakras are described as spinning wheels of light energy flowing within and around the body.\n\nBy understanding how the chakra energy system functions within you, you\u2019ll have the wisdom to understand what\u2019s happening in your life and the tools to be the master of your life.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of the seven weeks you will:\n\nhave created your own manual for the chakras to use at home\nknow how to listen to your own physical, emotional, mental and spiritual messages\nbe armed with a tool kit life\nunderstand the fundamental knowledge of mind-body medicine through the chakras\nbe in inspired to make choices and change in your life necessary for making the most out of life.\u00a0\n\n\nA message from Kate\n\n\u201cOne of the most fascinating aspects of my work which underpins my love for complementary medicine and inspires me to learn more every day is the profound links between the body > emotions >\u00a0 mind > soul > energy > environment. I get so much joy and reward from facilitating the process for each participant to understand their own patterns and what to do about it. If you\u2019ve worked with me, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about - you walk away seeing your challenges, knowing your strengths and the resources to flourish. I\u2019ve personally been through the chakra process and it\u2019s beautiful, fun and insightful. I can\u2019t wait to guide you through it and show you some powerful and enjoyable techniques.
