Wagatani village was flooded under a dam in 1965 and the tradition of the tray making became lost. Its rim and bottom are carved out of a single piece of fresh, un-dried wood and there are vertical chisel marks that feature on the tray.\nThis style of tray appears to have been made by several woodworkers in the village and came in various sizes that depended on what scrap materials were available for use at the time. Very few of the original trays have been found outside the vicinity of Wagatani, so this suggests that they may have been locally bartered for food and daily necessities by the woodworkers.\nShinichi Moriguchi has been in the heart of reviving this once lost tray making. He has been making the tray and teaching Wagata-bon making to pass the tradition to young maker in Japan.\nHiroshi has learnt this skill in 2017 in Japan under Shinichi Moriguchi. Hiroshi is aiming to revive this style of tray making in Australia,\u00a0 to conect with chestnut project in Sassafras Nuts farm, in his Japanese way.\n\nWhy using chestnut at Sassafras Nuts?\nChestnut was used for this traditional Wagata-bon making in Japan. Chestnut is a great material for various craft making.\u00a0\nChestnut trees in Sassafras Nuts farm are cut down when they come to the end of their nut production life.

So in 1861 a group of enterprising local gentlemen lead by james Robertson set to build their fortunes by making cement near the little settlement of Schnapper Point. They constructed 2 Kilns, a well, mills, settling tanks and a jetty. Today the town is known as Mornington and only ruins remain so what happened?\nAn archaeological dig and subsequent report in the late 1960's has been used by the Fossil beach interest group to assist with some new signs so that more people will know about the interesting tale of Victorias first cement works. So come and join them for a small celebration and morning bushwalk as they show you around Fossil Beach. we do mean bushwalk as there are no tracks to most of the ruins.",

A good pair of walking shoes is recommended. You will need a DSLR camera, empty memory card and charged battery. We will provide the off-camera-flash, light stands and triggers (or bring your own if you wish).\n\n\n\n\n\nCome and enjoy a fantastic DSLR photography learning session, with two great instructors and brilliant locations.\n\n\n",
