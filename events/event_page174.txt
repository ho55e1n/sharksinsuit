By completion, attendees will feel confident in their understanding of the technique, know when and how to apply it, be confident using the tool, and be able to interpret the results or review the work of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo maximise the learning potential of the group, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in group exercises and share their knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop topics will include:\r\nEstablishing remediation objectives\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntroduction\u00a0\u2013 triggers for remediation, what are remediation objectives, underlying principles, interlinkages with NEPM\r\n5 key steps \u2013 how to develop and/or revise remediation objectives\r\n\r\nCost-benefit and sustainability analysis\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntroduction \u2013 What is CB&SA, what guidance is available, what does the terminology mean, and when should it be conducted.\r\nThe 8-step process \u2013 Detail of each step, and how to modify the process for any site size or budget.\r\nData collection \u2013 What to collect and why, the level of detail required, and when more data is valuable.\r\nConducting weighting \u2013 How to choose indicators, and how to run a weighting session at different levels of complexity.\r\nUsing the Tool \u2013 Data entry, graphs, results tables, and troubleshooting.\r\nInterpreting the results \u2013 What does it all mean, and communicating key outcomes to stakeholders.\r\nRegulators \u2013 What to look for, what to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho should attend?\r\nThe workshop is aimed at people who have no experience conducting CB&SA or other economic analyses, but it is assumed that attendees will have mid-level knowledge of the contaminated sites industry. The content will be of interest to regulators, industry professionals and consultants who are required to perform, review and interpret CB&SAs.\r\nThe workshop includes a strong practical component and attendees are required to bring a laptop computer (and charger) to fully participate.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSchedule\r\n8.15 AM \u2013 8.45 AM Arrival\r\n\r\nCoffee and tea on arrival\r\nAttendees find their name badge and workshop registration package\u00a0\r\nAttendees find a table and setup their computers\r\n\r\n8:45 AM \u2013 9:00 AM\u2028\u00a0Welcome and introduction\r\n\r\nIntroduce trainers\u00a0\r\nHear from attendees of their experience\r\nOutline objectives for the workshop\r\nHear what the attendees wish to gain from the workshop\r\nHealth and safety matters including emergency procedures and nearest washrooms facilities\r\n\r\n9:00 AM \u2013 10:00 AM\u00a0\u2028 Establishing remediation objectives\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat are remediation objectives\u00a0\r\n5 key steps in developing remediation objectives\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n10:00 AM\u00a0\u2013 10:15 AM\u00a0 Morning break\u00a0\r\n10:15 AM\u00a0\u2013 10:45 AM\u00a0 Introduction to CB&SA\u00a0\r\n\r\nBackground and economic basis\u00a0\r\nTerminology\r\nThe 8 steps process\u00a0\r\n\r\n10:45 AM \u2013\u00a011:15 AM\u00a0 Data Collection\u00a0\r\n\r\nStakeholder engagement\u00a0\r\nChoosing indicators\u00a0\r\nGatehring information\u00a0\r\n\r\n11:15 AM\u00a0\u2013 12:15 PM\u00a0 Practical exercise as a group\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow to conduct weighting\u00a0\r\n\r\n12:15 PM \u2013\u00a01:15 PM\u2028\u00a0\u00a0Lunch break\u00a0\r\n1:15\u00a0 PM\u00a0\u2013\u00a02:15\u00a0 PM\u2028\u00a0\u00a0Practical exercise as a group\u00a0\r\n\r\nUsing the tool\u00a0\r\nTroubleshooting the tool\u00a0\r\n\r\n2:15 PM \u2013 3:00 PM\u00a0\u2028 Interpreting the results\u00a0\r\n3:00 PM \u2013\u00a03:15 PM\u2028\u00a0 Afternoon break\u00a0\r\n3:15 PM\u00a0\u2013\u00a04:15 PM\u2028\u00a0 Practical exercise as a group\u00a0\r\n\r\nInflection points and when more data is valuable\u00a0\r\nUncertainity\u00a0\r\n\r\n4:15 PM\u00a0\u2013\u00a04:45 PM\u00a0 Using the results\u00a0\r\n\r\nTalking to stakeholders about the results\r\nUsing the results in consulting\r\nWhat to look for as a regulator\u00a0\r\n\r\n4:45 PM\u00a0\u2013\u00a05:00 PM\u00a0 General discussions - open forum for questions\r\n\r\nPresenters\r\n\r\nSusan Barnes (B. Env. Science),\u00a0Coram ConsultingCost-benefit and sustainability analysis\u00a0\r\nSusan has 10 years\u2019 experience in the contaminated sites industry, most recently working with CRC\u00a0CARE on the harmonisation of the National Remediation Framework. Susan has worked as a field scientist and project manager at consultancies in both Adelaide and Sydney and has a broad range of experience with site investigation techniques, remediation strategies, site management, health and safety, project management, budget and program controls, technical writing and client liaison.\r\nSusan has deep experience with the National Remediation Framework Guideline on performing cost-benefit and sustainability assessment of remediation options that is the basis of this workshop. She project managed the team that authored the guideline, provided specialist advice to ensure the economic principles were applicable to contaminated sites work, directed the design of the accompanying CB&SA tool, authored the case studies published in the guideline, and has applied the technique in a commercial setting to provide advice to clients.\r\nThroughout her career Susan has designed and delivered several training courses on a range of subject matters, including online learning, class-based learning and small-group technical workshops such as this. She has a casual and open style that focuses on learning outcomes and practical exercises.\r\nSusan left full time contaminated sites consulting in 2016, and now runs her own technical writing consultancy Coram Consulting part time, while completing a Bachelor of Social Science majoring in Gender Studies at Macquarie University. She is working towards a PhD focusing on diverse employees in STEM careers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJoytishna Jit (PhD, MA, BAS), CRC CARE/University of South AustraliaSelecting remediation objectives\u00a0\r\nJoyti is a Research Fellow at the University of South Australia and has been responsible for leading or participating in a number of guidance development projects in the Best Practice Policy Program, CRC CARE. She has over 12 years training and experience as scientist and policy analyst in the interdisciplinary areas of environmental, social and legal research. Joyti has published and contributed to national and international technical and policy projects in previous positions held in academia, industry and inter-governmental organisations. She has qualifications in applied science (BAS), marine management (MA) and law (PhD).\r\nOver the previous five years, Joyti has focused on site contamination issues that are of national interest, including the development of guidance on contaminants of emerging concern including PFAS and petroleum hydrocarbons, the use of flux in groundwater management, and the development of the National Remediation Framework (NRF). Joyti\u2019s contribution in the NRF has been to provide support in the development of the framework with the project management team, and also as a contributor to the framework material. Joyti was responsible for drafting the NRF Guideline on establishing remediation objectives.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nHotel Grand Chancellor Melbourne\u00a0 \u00a0131, Lonsdale Street , Melbourne, VIC 3000\r\n\r\nCost\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0AUD $ 695 (ex GST)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscount\r\n10% off for employees of CRC CARE Participant organisations\u00a0\r\nTo obtain a discount code for this workshop, please contact one of the following:\r\n\r\nYour company's CRC CARE representative\r\nRatin Mathur (ratin.mathur@crccare.com / 08 8302 3933)\r\n\r\nRefund policy\r\nRefunds are permitted up to 7 days before the event start date.
