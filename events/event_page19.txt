Amelia has the answer!\u00a0\n\nWhat to Expect \u2026\nAmelia begins the 2-hr workshop by teaching the audience a quick way to align with Source Energy, go through a \u201cSoul Fragment Retrieval\u201d exercise and she\u2019ll conduct a \u201cDNA Activation\u201d while the audience meditates to some beautiful medicine music. This is the 30-minutes.\nOnce the audience is energetically ready to receive, Amelia will jump right in and choose an audience member to share their question / fear, in which Amelia will Channel Messages to answer.\nWhether you feel your question was answered or not, every audience member will benefit on more than an energetic level. Just being in the room will raise your vibrational energy and that of our earth. It\u2019ll be a great co-creating and healing workshop!\n\nWhat Amelia Does \u2026\nAs a human BEing, we all have challenges which we face in our lives and sometimes, we just need some guidance and clarity on a situation. This is were Amelia helps \u2026 She will channel messages from various sources and say the right thing at the right time, every time.\nAmelia channels 3 different higher realm energies \u2026 \u201cThe Council\u201d of the Light (think 12 different beings of all colours, shapes, sizes and races), \u201cThe Scholars\u201d (think Gregorian Chant) and \u201cThe Z\u2019s\u201d (think Lee Harris, just different ones). Amelia has 3 Guides she works with \u2026 Running with Wolves (A native American Indian Sharman Leader who was her \u201cFather\u201d in another life), Angelo the Wolf and Archangel Raphael. Each of her guides help in different ways and serve different purposes. As well as all this, Amelia can see Spirits not just of this life but that of others. She can tell you which life, the year and describe so many details, it can get overwhelming at times.\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Please understand, if you are not registered and, in the room, seated by 2:00pm, you forfeit your ticket and won\u2019t be let in the room. Once the doors close and the workshop begins, there can not be any disruptions.\n\nDisclaimers / T & C\u2019s\n*Messages provided by Amelia White are for guidance, healing and support only. Amelia does not take responsibility for what you choose to do with the information provided, including any actions you may take as a result. The actions you take and the choices you make, are solely your responsibility.\n*This workshop may be recorded/filmed, and photos will be taken, for use by Amelia White and her business Soulfull Emergence, in marketing and will be made public on her websites and social media accounts.\n*Seating is unallocated therefore, the earlier you get there the better.\u00a0\n*This workshop is not suitable for anyone under the age of 15 years old.

                "text": "CuddleParty.com DetailsAlthough I've run successful Cuddle Huddle's before, as part of my commitment to furthering my Cuddle Education, I've decided to join forces with the CuddleParty.com team and complete their training. For this reason I'm obliged to inform you I'm a \"facilitator-in-training\" for CuddleParty.com and this is a Review Party.\nCan't wait to see you there.\n\n\nWhat is a Cuddle Huddle? A Cuddle Huddle is an event where participants share consensual, nurturing touch. Everyone is clothed, and the event is non-sexual. The energy is intended to be more relaxing and soothing, rather than arousing or stimulating. Touch might include holding hands, exchanging back, shoulder, or foot massage, light facial touch, holding, playing with hair, or spooning. The importance of open communication is emphasized. This includes stating one\u2019s own needs and boundaries, as well as asking for permission. More boisterous activities at snuggle parties can include playful wrestling, cuddle huddles (many people blissfully snuggled together), and pillow fights.\nWhat a Cuddle Huddle is not: - A Cuddle Huddle is NOT a sexual event- A Cuddle Huddle is NOT a dating/hook up event\nWho are Cuddle Huddles for? - ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY! (channeling my inner Vanessa Amorosi) - Cuddle Huddles are welcoming to all ages, genders, sexual orientations and relationship dynamics. - Cuddle Huddles are for anyone wanting to meet new people, to further their ability to powerfully communicate what they want and don\u2019t want specifically in the area of touch and non-specifically in all areas of life. - Cuddle Huddles are for those who want to experience and reap the benefits of touch in a fun, safe, non-expectational environment.\nBenefits of Cuddle Huddles:- Feel more connected to others.- Resonate with friends on a deeper heartfelt level.- Physical affection is more readily available beyond romantic and sexual relationships.- Relationships are no longer \u201call-or-nothing\u201d when it comes to nourishing physical touch.- Find a refreshing middle ground between platonic friends who share little or no physical contact, and romantic connections who share all types of contact.- Be more practiced at saying \u201cYes\u201d to what you really want and \u201cNo\u201d to what you don\u2019t want, while empowering others around you to do the same.- Your relationships and romances will no longer be overshadowed by touch-related \u201cneediness.\u201d- You\u2019re helping to create a healthier, more integrated, holistic, sustainable understanding of how touch and connectedness function in our lives.\nGround Rules:- This is an 18+ event- Personal hygiene: Please avoid perfumes or any other strongly scented products, as some people are sensitive to them. Make sure you've showered or bathed recently. Stay at home if you have a potentially contagious illness.- Please respect the other participants at all times.

                "html": "<P><STRONG>CuddleParty.com Details<BR></STRONG>Although I've run successful Cuddle Huddle's before, as part of my commitment to furthering my Cuddle Education, I've decided to join forces with the CuddleParty.com team and complete their training. For this reason I'm obliged to inform you I'm a \"facilitator-in-training\" for CuddleParty.com and this is a Review Party.</P>\n<P>Can't wait to see you there.</P>\n<HR>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>What is a Cuddle Huddle? </STRONG><BR>A Cuddle Huddle is an event where participants share consensual, nurturing touch. Everyone is clothed, and the event is non-sexual. The energy is intended to be more relaxing and soothing, rather than arousing or stimulating. Touch might include holding hands, exchanging back, shoulder, or foot massage, light facial touch, holding, playing with hair, or spooning. The importance of open communication is emphasized. This includes stating one\u2019s own needs and boundaries, as well as asking for permission. More boisterous activities at snuggle parties can include playful wrestling, cuddle huddles (many people blissfully snuggled together), and pillow fights.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What a Cuddle Huddle is not: </STRONG><BR>- A Cuddle Huddle is NOT a sexual event<BR>- A Cuddle Huddle is NOT a dating/hook up event</P>\n<P><STRONG>Who are Cuddle Huddles for? </STRONG><BR>- ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY! (channeling my inner Vanessa Amorosi) <BR>- Cuddle Huddles are welcoming to all ages, genders, sexual orientations and relationship dynamics. <BR>- Cuddle Huddles are for anyone wanting to meet new people, to further their ability to powerfully communicate what they want and don\u2019t want specifically in the area of touch and non-specifically in all areas of life. <BR>- Cuddle Huddles are for those who want to experience and reap the benefits of touch in a fun, safe, non-expectational environment.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Benefits of Cuddle Huddles:</STRONG><BR>- Feel more connected to others.<BR>- Resonate with friends on a deeper heartfelt level.<BR>- Physical affection is more readily available beyond romantic and sexual relationships.<BR>- Relationships are no longer \u201call-or-nothing\u201d when it comes to nourishing physical touch.<BR>- Find a refreshing middle ground between platonic friends who share little or no physical contact, and romantic connections who share all types of contact.<BR>- Be more practiced at saying \u201cYes\u201d to what you really want and \u201cNo\u201d to what you don\u2019t want, while empowering others around you to do the same.<BR>- Your relationships and romances will no longer be overshadowed by touch-related \u201cneediness.\u201d<BR>- You\u2019re helping to create a healthier, more integrated, holistic, sustainable understanding of how touch and connectedness function in our lives.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Ground Rules:</STRONG><BR>- This is an 18+ event<BR>- Personal hygiene: Please avoid perfumes or any other strongly scented products, as some people are sensitive to them. Make sure you've showered or bathed recently. Stay at home if you have a potentially contagious illness.<BR>- Please respect the other participants at all times. Unwanted or inappropriate actions will not be tolerated and participants not following the ground rules will be removed from the space. <BR>- Please refrain from using any substances that may inhibit judgement or prevent you from being fully present.
