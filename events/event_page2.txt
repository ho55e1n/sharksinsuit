Some people come to Grow while struggling with a life crisis such as the loss of a loved one, a job or a relationship.\nIt can be extraordinarily liberating and affirming to share problems with others who are encouraging and accepting, and facing similar issues!\nGrow meetings are run by the members themselves, according to a well-structured format. During the meeting, members can share their problems, learn how to re-build their lives and report on their own progress. Grow\u2019s program of personal growth is based on changing negative thinking and behaviour. It offers strategies on how to:\n\n\nDeal with an emotional crisis,\n\n\nManage feelings,\u00a0\n\n\nThink by reason,\u00a0\n\n\nRealize personal worth, and\u00a0\n\n\nImprove relationships.\n\n\nDeveloping understanding, acceptance, confidence, control and love is at the heart of the Grow program. Many people have been able to rebuild lives with the help of Grow. Meetings are supportive, non-threatening, positive and constructive. Members are known in their group on a first name basis only and make a commitment to confidentiality. No fees are charged, however a small donation to meet necessary expenses is usual, though strictly voluntary. A variety of training and social activities backs up the essential group process.",
