With the end of the Cold War, multiple national and transnational narratives have informed the cultural meanings of the Korean DMZ, which include hopes for interKorean reconciliation, dystopian futures of climate change and mass extinction, and what I identify as a South Korean peace imaginary that has emerged out of this particular historical conjuncture. This imaginary animates diverse discourses of peace, life, and nature, which are easy to dismiss as naive and romanticizing, but by focusing attention on actual multispecies encounters, this paper suggests how the DMZ\u2019s ecologies might yet offer cosmopolitical alternatives to geopolitics as usual.\nEleana Kim\u00a0is associate professor of anthropology at UC Irvine, and the author ofAdopted Territory: Transnational Korean\u00a0Adoptees and the Politics of Belonging\u00a0(Duke UP, 2010), which received the James B. Palais Prize from the Association of Asian Studies, and the Social Science Book Award from the Association of Asian American Studies. Her\u00a0research on the ecologies of the Korean DMZ has been funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation and the ACLS, and related articles may be found in\u00a0Cultural Anthropology,\u00a0Social Research, and the forthcoming edited volume,\u00a0How Nature Works\u00a0(SAR Press).\u00a0\nEnquiries: Dr. Ryan Gustafsson, gus@unimelb.edu.au\nPhoto:\u00a0Nicola Kountoupes\nThe University of Melbourne acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nations on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. We respectfully acknowledge their Ancestors and Elders, past, present and emerging.\nAccessibility information for Arts West:\nThe pathway on the North East side of\u00a0Arts West (Building 148)\u00a0provides a continuous accessible path of travel to the cloister via the gardens. Once in the undercover cloister there are automated doors at both the North-West and South-East ends of the building. Alternatively there is access off Medical Road. At this entrance there is a platform lift to ascend to ground level. There is also a ramp at the northern end of the\u00a0Baillieu Library (Building 177)\u00a0that connects to the Arts West Atrium.\nOnce inside the Atrium there is an inclined surface that provides access to the lifts for the North and West wings. These provide access to every level. Moving between the North and West wings is either at grade, via a ramp within the atrium or lift near the western stair.",
