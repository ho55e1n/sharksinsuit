Jane's commitment to my success was absolute; she saw more in me than I saw in myself. Because of working with Jane, I have been braver than I knew I could be. I've achieved more, faster than I thought possible. If you want to be a woman of influence, you need Jane Anderson in your life!\"\r\nDr. Emily Verstege\u00a0Mentee | Customer Experience Expert | Speaker | Author | Mentor\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Before working with Jane Anderson I was really doubting my choice to run a business. Despite having the skills and knowledge to create amazing work for my clients I just wasn't able to translate that into a successful business. Jane has shown me how to connect with my audience in a way that suits them and builds trust. She has also shown me how to effectively nurture existing business relationships to grow my business quickly.\r\nIt's now 4 days into the new month and I have only 3 days of availability left to book in. On top of that my average sale has increased by 25% to 100%. And that is not from simply increasing prices, it's from being able to communicate with my clients on what services I can provide to them, it's educating them on what is best for their business and on how to leverage their time and investment with me.\"\r\nKerrin Smith\u00a0Client | Photography Expert",
