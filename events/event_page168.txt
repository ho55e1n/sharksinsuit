In this first part of the session we separate fact from fiction. We provide\u00a0information about what ice is, why people use it and why it causes problems for users, families\u00a0and the broader community. We help people identify if family members are using ice and\u00a0their patterns of drug use.  Most importantly, we explain the process by which people decide to seek help for their drug\u00a0use and how families can support these decisions.\n  TOPIC 2: STRATEGIES\nBreakThrough isn\u2019t just about ice. We also look more broadly at the relationship between drug use and mental health and provide practical strategies to help family members discuss drug use and keep the lines of communication open.  Of course, the path to recovery from drug use is not always straightforward. Managing challenging behaviours and developing strategies to keep family members safe and functioning during difficult times are also part of the program.\n TOPIC 3: HELP\nThe last topic of BreakThrough provides families with the skills and knowledge to navigate the\u00a0treatment system and obtain the best possible outcomes for their loved ones. We also look at some of the barriers to seeking help and how to overcome these.  All family members attending the workshop will be given information on where to get help and\u00a0support following the completion of the workshop and options for ongoing support activities.",

                "text": "\nThe Mindfulness Works exclusive 4-week introductory course provides you with an opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness.\nWHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?\n\n4 x classes\u00a0\n45-page guidebook\n4 week free gift subscription to the Calm premium mindfulness app\nWeekly emails with extra articles and instructions\nDownloadable guided mindfulness meditations for you to keep\n\nABOUT MINDFULNESS WORKS\nMindfulness Works is one of Australia's largest mindfulness training organisation. Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course. Mindfulness takes time to develop as a habit and a full 4-week course allows you to practise between classes; giving you a greater opportunity to experience the benefits of mindfulness for yourself in a real way.\nNO RISK MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:\u00a0 If you attend all the classes (complete the course) and don\u2019t feel you have received any benefit, you are entitled to a full 100% money-back refund. You still get to keep all the course materials, downloadable guided meditations, workbook and app.\nEXCLUSIVE 45-PAGE GUIDEBOOK: Our exclusive 45-page professionally-designed Mindfulness Works guidebook is for you to keep. This includes weekly assignments, lots of articles and a reading list.\nFREE 4 WEEK GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CALM PREMIUM MINDFULNESS APP:\u00a0\u00a0All participants on courses \u00a0receive a free 4 week gift subscription to the full version of the award-winning Calm Mindfulness and Meditation App. PLUS get a 25% off the price of a 12 month subscription to Calm premium.\nNO RELIGION.

We sit in chairs, the language used is clear and modern.\nEXPERIENCED AND WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHERS:Receive guidance from experienced mindfulness teachers who have received our Mindfulness Works teacher training and partake in ongoing professional development.\n\nCOURSE TOPICS:\nWeek 1: What is Mindfulness and What are the Benefits?\nWeek 2: Mindfulness and The Thinking Mind\nWeek 3: Mindfulness and Emotions\nWeek 4: Mindfulness and Self-Compassion\n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE SUITABLE FOR?\nThis course is suitable for absolute beginners who have no or very little mindfulness and meditation experience. This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS NEIL SHEPHERD\n\nNeil is passionate about personal development. He sees it as a means towards living a calmer, happier and more interesting life, and he is keen to share this with others.\nNeil started his practice over 17 years ago, mostly seeking strategies to better manage the life challenges he was experiencing at the time. After an experience with mindfulness and meditation, he developed a fascination for it and has since participated in a significant number of meditation retreats, practices and workshops. Some interesting examples are several years of mindfulness meditation practice with a Buddhist lama, the challenging \u201cVipassana\u201d 10-day silent retreat, and an Eckhart Tolle retreat in Costa Rica. He also practised yoga for a number of years to help with mind-body connection.\nNeil comes from a corporate background in Information Systems, Business Intelligence, Data Analytics, Consulting, Systems Management, Business Improvement, Presenting and Training.\nHe is inspired by natural beauty, travel and creativity. As an avid traveller, he has trekked and motorcycled through Nepal, walked Tasmania\u2019s 7-day Overland Track and motor-homed through Europe along with numerous other travel adventures!\nNeil's ethos is \u201cLife is to experience\u201d. His focus is also to simplify where possible, be kind, and avoid anything too extreme \u2013 he believes the world could do with some more smiles and kindness!\nNeil's website is\u00a0InnerSynergy.com.au\nInstagram: innersynergy_canberra\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.
