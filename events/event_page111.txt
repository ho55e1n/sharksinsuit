Drypoints appear similar to etchings, but do not require using acid and can be made with a variety of materials. This will be combined with chine-coll\u00e9 and montotype to further enrich and diversify the images created.\n\n\nWeek 1 (21 or 22 May)Introduction to the general concepts of intaglio and drypoint methods. Warm up with some simple drawing exercises before creating your first drypoint plate.\nWeek 2 (28 or 29 May)Learn how to ink the plates and use a press to print intaglio images. Continue to build and change the image.\nWeek 3 (4 or 5 June)Use the collage-like technique of chine-coll\u00e9 to add colour and complexity to the printed image.\nWeek 4 (11 or 12 June)Artist of the week: Clarice Beckett. The way Clarice Beckett saw the world is fascinating, in hazy, blurred and often muted tones. We will experiment with these concepts.\nWeek 5 (18 or 19 June)Artist of the week: Fred Williams. Jumping forward in time, we will examine Williams\u2019 passion for the Australian landscape as seen from above. Williams often worked in gouache on paper; we will examine these, and make a work inspired by his ideas.\nWeek 6 (25 or 26 June)Artist of the week: John Wolseley. A contemporary artist who mostly works in watercolour, found ochres and charcoal and often damaged paper. Experiment with some natural ochre as well as watercolours.\n\nCost\u00a0>\n$270\nAll materials will be provided.\n\n\nMore info >\nPlease contact Belconnen Arts Centre via email, or phone (02) 6173 3300.\n",
