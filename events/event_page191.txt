                "text": "The Crises In Our Classrooms\nCreating a Classroom Environment That Helps Students Grow\nStudies on the mental health of school principals and teachers are now in mainstream media.\nPrincipals reported higher levels of burnout than the general population, twice as much difficulty sleeping as a result of stress and were at higher risk of depression.\u00a0ABC news Jan 2018\nSydney Morning Herald\u00a0reported in 2017\u00a0that, 'Up to half of all Australian teachers are leaving the profession in the first five years.'\nThe sheer quantity of work and a lack of time to focus on teaching and learning were the two biggest causes of stress.\n\nOur Students Are Suffering Also.\nIt\u2019s not just our teachers and school leaders that are suffering but also our students. Many classroom teachers are dealing with students who display:\n\n\nA lack of focus and attention that often leads to ...\n\n\nDisruptive behaviour that often leads to poor attendance and this leads to...\n\n\nPoor academic performance and confidence. It becomes a negative self-fulfilling prophecy!\n\n\nSadly, the interventions to make this better and improve the classroom experience for students and teachers miss a crucial component - the link between mental health and school performance.\n\n\nNearly half (47 per cent) of Australian students feel very tense when they study, compared to the international average of 37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the OECD average, 67 per cent of Australian students report feeling very anxious even if well prepared for a test, compared to the international average of 56 per cent (64 per cent for girls and 47 per cent for boys).\n\n\nSchool-based stress reduction programs based on mindful play, fun and movement, have been shown to be effective in the United States. Similar programs would benefit Australian school children.\n\nThe Brain Play Professional Development\nWe\u2019ve developed The Brain Play Professional Development to support classroom teachers and school leaders to change the environment of their school and classrooms so that the entire school community can flourish.\nThe day aims to gamify mental health and wellbeing through movement, fun, and play.\n\u00a0\nFun Brain Breaks\nOur brains are wired for novelty. We know this because we pay attention to every stimulus in our environment that feels threatening or out of the ordinary.\nWhen presented with new material, standards, and complicated topics, we need to be focused and calm as we approach our assignments.\nWe can use brain breaks and focused-attention practices to positively impact our emotional states and learning.\nFun brain breaks refocus our neural circuitry with either stimulating or quieting practices that generate increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, where problem solving and emotional regulation occur.
