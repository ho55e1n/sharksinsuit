There are dreams that don\u2019t land until they are told to someone else and the telling helps some magic to be worked or some healing or transformation to occur. There are others which require action on our part: the subduing of something that oppresses us, an act of faith or courage, a putting into effect in our own lives and communities of something suggested by or asked of us in the dream. And then there are other dreams that belong to the community, that speak to things that are shared in common, or changes that have or are coming into effect, or that address societal or community injustices and point the way forward.\nIn the traditions of my people dreams were the method of selecting kings and kings were married to the earth, to temper their execution of power. In this example, dreams are a necessary component in ensuring that relationships among humans and between humans and the earth are kept respectful and in check.\u00a0\nWe are in a time where this is not the case. Where the practice of power is untempered and human greed is destroying life-forms and life-ways at a rapid pace. We can dream our way into something else but not if we dream in isolation and without proper discourse around our dreams.\nThis dream circle has grown out of my own dreaming practice and my increasing awareness of the importance of dreaming in bringing us back into relationship with ourselves, each other and the earth.\nIf you feel that this approach to dreams and dreaming is something you\u2019d like to explore, if you are a powerful dreamer but don\u2019t know what to do with that, or if you are wanting to gain more of an understanding about the different ways of honouring and working with different types of dreams, then please get in touch.\nGatherings are held on a monthly basis at Seven Mirrors in Central Ballarat.

The cost of the class is only $20.00 + booking fee, plus membership if you haven't yet joined. If you are not a member please join prior to booking at https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/membership/individual \n\nHaving a Baby? Have you got questions about Breastfeeding?\nCome to our relaxed information-packed sessions for expectant parents and learn about the best start you can give your baby. Although breastfeeding is natural and important for babies and mothers, it doesn't always come easily and is a learned art. Most women given time and support can, and do, breastfeed. Our aim is to provide expectant parents with confidence to successfully breastfeed their babies.\nOur courses are designed for expectant parents to prepare for the vital days, weeks and months after their baby's birth. We encourage parents to attend while pregnant, ideally before 30 weeks to allow for the mother's comfort and babies who arrive early. (Of course, we are also happy to accommodate those further along than this!) These sessions aim to expand upon the knowledge gained at antenatal classes, to give up-to-date information and insights into breastfeeding a baby and parenting in the early days.\n\nMy baby is due in the next few weeks. The class I want says it is fully booked! HELP!\nPlease book early to avoid disappointment as places are limited and classes fill up quickly. We are generally not able to take extra people and do not hold waiting lists for fully booked classes. However, your local group of the Australian Breastfeeding Association may have upcoming meetings you can attend before your baby is due.\nPLACES ARE LIMITED SO EARLY REGISTRATION IS RECOMMENDED\nRegistration and membership includes:\n\nApprox\u00a03 to 4 hour workshop-style class, including time for refreshments \nComplimentary handout material \nOne-year membership of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, which includes the book Breastfeeding ... naturally, valued at $35.00\nIntroduction to your local ABA network of discussions and other services for pregnant and new parents\nOne year subscription to Australian Breastfeeding Association magazine \"Essence\" \n50% discount on breast pump hire rates\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Motov8ing Boys is an event for boys aged 11-17 and their parents.\nDo you worry about your son\u2019s behaviour or attitude; or maybe he needs help building his confidence?\nDoes your son struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr maybe you're tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse get no response at all?\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. Unfortunately this often leads to various problems at home, at school and with friends both on & off line.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motivating Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8?\nJohn is a youth specialist with over 27years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across South East Victoria. Through the \"Ride of Life\" & Raging Bull seminars, delivered in schools, John has helped influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nWhilst the clich\u00e9 statement \"Boys will be boys\" is a often used to explain why boys do silly things, as a personal coach/mentor and parent himself, John would rather see this statement reflect a different sentiment. John and his company, Motov8, aim to inspire boys to choose to become awesome young men rather than just accept what others say they will be.\u00a0\nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?\nMotov8ting Boys' is an event for Pre-teen and Teenage Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; to assist them to understand the power of positive attitude, develop confidence, change destructive behaviour, Identify personal potential & understand the importance of self respect & respecting others. \nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's this same reason they don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way, and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nSo after talking with school principals, community leaders & parents John decided to develop and host an event that addresses this exact concern.... and deliver it in a way that parents won't have to drag their boys kicking & screaming.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. John engages boys and young males through the use of motorcycles and utilities his years of rider experience to help them to navigate through the bumps in the road.\nThere will be a room full of some very cool motorcycles (Including a custom Harley Breakout, Aprilia Rsv4 race bike, KTM 300 & KTM 450) awesome video footage from both dirt & road racing.\nWhat parents are saying about this event & The Rev.\nEmma Munnoch Dec 6th Perth event.\u00a0 Inspiration and hope knowing we as parents of young Male teens are not alone in this journey. We all come with a past and should not let that effect our future potential...hearing Revs story was so close to my sons experiences at school....we are committed to help make change....every school needs a opportunity like this to help boys reach their fullest potential. My son thought it was wicked and as a family that follows moto gp and rides dirt bikes can really relate to the analogies made. He also said it was like a weight lifted when our family shared an experience that was quite traumatic to us all...I am sure this night has opened the gates of communication for our son to move forward and to talk about what's been holding him back. Blake and Josh also made him feel great at the end of the night too. Well done Rev and gang.\n\nCourtney Ekenberg Dec 3rd Ringwood event.\u00a0 The best part of tonight was walking out of there and hearing my son tell me how great that was. We spoke for a good 15 minutes during our drive home, and 15 minutes is a long time for my son! He had this drive and positive attitude that had him talking about, not only his problems but what he can do to make things better. He had that feeling of reassurance that he has the ability to make a change and to be one. I'm so grateful for the time Rev gave my son after the seminar. Just enough to encourage him. We loved hearing all about his life story and the rawness to it. It was real and you just can't bet that. Thank you MotoV8 for being apart of this journey, that we (parents and teenages) are just trying to figure out.\nAnnette Sayers Dec 3rd Rinwood event.\u00a0 Wow.... I attended Motov8 boys in Ringwood tonight and as disappointed as I was that my 15 yr old didn\u2019t attend, I was truly grateful and blown away with the Rev share and the connection he made with the boys and parents in the room.\u00a0 Rev speaks from his heart, sharing his vulnerability and connecting through storytelling. This event is for boys and as much for parents. It guides parents into creating awareness into parenting, allows parents to shine a light on whats not working and gives them strategics to be able to handle raising teenagers. \u201cIt\u2019s tough being a teen and it\u2019s even tougher raising one!\u201d, - REV\u00a0 \u201cIF YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS DONE, YOU WILL ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS GOT\u201d - Albert Einstein and many others.\u00a0 If you are thinking about attending one of Rev\u2019s events, NOW is the time to say YES to you and your family. DO IT for you, DO IT for your kids. DO IT for your family. We are all worth it.\u00a0 Thank you Rev, rock on, love your work. \nFloss Cubbin Nov 17th Grafton NSW event. Rev held a workshop in Grafton. It was completely different to what I was expecting but was exactly what young boys/ teens can relate to.\u00a0 The fact that he shares his personal experiences and is brave enough to discuss personal issues is exactly what the youth need. To know it\u2019s ok to reach out, to know that we don\u2019t always make the best choices but there is always someone there to help u out and it\u2019s never too late.\u00a0 Rev seemed very perceptive in knowing what signs to look for and had some useful strategies that can help. I would recommend one of his workshops and I\u2019m looking forward to his return next year.\u00a0 Thanks again\n\nKylie Messanger Nov 13th Grafton NSW event.\u00a0 Rev... Your impact is huge not just on the kids but on the parents... Thank you for keeping it real & thank you for telling it how it is. I loved seeing the impression you had on some of those boys tonight who stood up and told you just how awesome you made them feel. You have changed their lives and empowered them in one session. That imprinted in my heart - an emotional moment and they weren't even my sons'.\u00a0 Thank you for telling your story and I can't wait for the next session - we will be there for sure! Again thank you for just being you.\u00a0 Good luck with our besties in Grafton tomorrow they won't be disappointed. The word spreads quickly!\nSeona Maybery My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2.5hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So so much to take away from this workshop. \nSo turn off the TV, Xbox or PS4 and bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some good advice that could just change your and their lives forever.",

Your womb of origin or the person who raised you. Mother love: making it all better or setting you straight. Maternal instincts and mother-powered superhuman acts. (Lifting a car, anyone?) Mama's boys, Mommy Dearest and Mr. Mom also welcome. Becoming a mother, finding a mother, or finally recognizing the wisdom of the one you got. (Please be sure that you bring a story about a mother, not an homage.)\nFor up-to-date local info, join our\u00a0Moth in Melbourne Facebook group.\n-------\nHow to Tell at The Moth StorySLAM\n\nConsult our calendar to find our published theme.\nConjure, channel, craft and compose your story.\nPractice so you can remember it without the benefits of paper. Then practice it so you can keep it down to five minutes. Tell it to your plants but know that they are a tough audience. Revise. Rework. Curse your plants for not believing in you! Revamp. Finesse. Shave off another two minutes. Try again. Voila! Forgive your plants. Indeed, they helped you see the light.\nCome to the Moth StorySLAM and put your name in the hat. If you are one of the lucky 10 picked, you\u2019ll have five minutes to woo the audience with tales of your on-theme escapades. Unpicked? Fear not, some variation of your theme will surely rise again. All stories have multiple themes and stretching them to fit can be fun and even bring out elements you hadn\u2019t recognized before.\nContestants are judged on sticking to the five-minute time frame, sticking to the theme and having a story that has a conflict and a resolution.\n\nBe forewarned:\nMoth stories are told, not read. We love how the storyteller connects with the audience when there is no PAGE between them! Please know your story \u201cby heart\u201d but not by rote memorization. No notes, paper or cheat sheets allowed on stage.\nHave some stakes.Stakes are essential in live storytelling.\u00a0\u00a0What do you stand to gain or lose? Why is what happens in the story important to you?\u00a0If you can\u2019t answer this, then think of a different story. A story without stakes is an essay and is best experienced on the page, not the stage.\nStart in the action.Have a great first line that sets up the stakes or grabs attention.\nNo: \u201cSo I was thinking about climbing this mountain.\u00a0\u00a0But then I watched a little TV and made a snack and took a nap and my mom called and vented about her psoriasis then I did a little laundry (a whites load) (I lost another sock, darn it!) and then I thought about it again and decided I\u2019d climb the mountain the next morning.\u201d\nYes: \u201cThe mountain loomed before me. I had my\u00a0hunting knife, some trail mix and snow boots. I had to make it to the\u00a0little cabin and start a fire before sundown or freeze to death for sure.\u201d\nSteer clear of meandering endingsThey kill a story! Your last line should be clear in your head before you start. Yes, bring the audience along with you as you contemplate what transpires in your story, but remember, you are driving the story, and must know the final destination. Keep your hands on the wheel!\nKnow your story well enough so you can have fun!Watching you panic\u00a0to think of the next memorized line is harrowing for the audience. Make an outline, memorize your bullet points and play with the details. Enjoy yourself. Imagine you are at a dinner party, not a deposition.\nNo standup routines please.The Moth LOVES funny people but requires that all funny people tell funny STORIES.\nNo rants:Take up this anger issue with your therapist, or skip therapy and shape your anger into a story with some sort of resolution. (Stories = therapy!)\nNo essays:Your eloquent musings are beautiful and look pretty on the page but unless you can make them gripping and set up stakes, they won\u2019t work on stage.\n\n\u00a0How to Be a StorySLAM Judge\n\nLet it be known! Seek out Moth team and ply with flattery and gifts, or just hang by the hat and ask!\nOnce picked, be wise and heed the rules.

Your womb of origin or the person who raised you. Mother love: making it all better or setting you straight. Maternal instincts and mother-powered superhuman acts. (Lifting a car, anyone?)

We don't find anything romantic about whistles, name-tags or over-the-top party trimmings typically found at singles events so we have done away with them. Creating an atmosphere that is at once casual and comfortable. It's what we call cheeky-chic!\nMeet a partner to attend concerts, music festivals, bar crawls or fitness classes. Someone who shares your passions and interests - from sports to yoga - all in a setting just your speed.\u00a0\n-\nOur personable hosts will assist you with your MyCheekyDate 'Date-Mate' Scorecard.
