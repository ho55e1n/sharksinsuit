For instructions,\u00a0click here.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Machine Learning Masterclass\nThis course is for experienced machine-learning practitioners who want to take their skills to the next level by using R to hone their abilities as predictive modellers.\nTrainees will learn essential techniques for real machine-learning model development, helping them to build more accurate models. In the masterclass, participants will work to deploy, test, and improve their models.\u00a0\nTopics covered will include data exploration, data preparation, feature engineering, and prediction, using advanced modelling techniques including glmnet, xgboost, and random forests. Participants will also\u00a0use unsupervised learning techniques to explore data and build features.\u00a0\nThe course will also cover advanced model-evaluation techniques such as n-fold cross validation, model ensembling techniques, and advanced tips and tricks.\u00a0\nThis course is suitable for trainees who have attended the courses \u201cIntroduction to R and Data\u00a0Visualisation\u201d and \u201cPredictive Analytics and Data Science\u201d, or for those with some knowledge of machine learning and R.\nCourse content may vary from this outline, and will be driven by class learning needs. This course may also be offered under other names.\nSee what former trainees are saying about this course.\n\nDiscounts\nGroup discounts also apply during the earlybird period: 5% for 2\u20134 people, 10% for 5\u20136 people, 15% for 7\u20138 people, and 20% for 9 or more people. Select your desired quantity of tickets and click \u201cAdd to cart\u201d to see the discount calculated before checkout.\nPlease contact us at enquiries@presciient.com to find out more about these special rates.\n\nCourse instructor\nCourses are taught by Dr Eugene Dubossarsky and his hand-picked team of highly skilled instructors.\n\nAbout our training\u00a0\nEugene Dubossarsky\u2019s courses are unlike those offered in universities, online, or by private providers. His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.\nDr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.\nThe resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world.

With specific regard to finance, Eugene has mentored and advised senior leaders and their teams in a number of major Australian banks.\n\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services\u00a0\n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course.

His data-science classes, in particular, give clients not just knowledge of a process, but the real power of understanding the underlying concepts, allowing them to confidently practice, manage, promote and risk-assess data science.</P>\n<P>Dr Dubossarsky says \u201cthe way many courses teach data science is like teaching people to memorise and recite poetry in a language they do not understand\u201d. By contrast, he confers an understanding of that language, taught in an intuitive, accessible way that leaves trainees with an instinct for data science. Keeping formulae and mathematics to a bare minimum and taking an intuitive, visual approach, Eugene\u2019s courses deliver a compressed mentoring experience as much as they do content. This is difficult for an average trainer to replicate. Trainees benefit from his extensive knowledge and over 20 years of commercial data-science experience, as well as his unique teaching style.</P>\n<P>The resulting testimonials speak for themselves, and candidates come from all walks of life: CEOs, general managers, salespeople, IT professionals, marketing staff, public servants and of course people from many functions in the finance world. These testimonials are extensive, and many more are available on request.

                "text": "The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations (AFDO) Disability Loop project is very fortunate to have received support from the Victorian Government to run a workshop about the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) around Victoria directly for people with disability and their families.\nThis workshop was written by a team of people with disability, some who are also NDIS participants. We believe that this allows the workshop to better meet the needs of people with a lived experience of disability. This workshop has been designed to make the NDIS easier to understand. In a small, interactive session, we will cover lots of different parts of the NDIS; from knowing who is eligible to get into the NDIS, working out what support you can get from the NDIS in your NDIS Plan, to actually using the funds in your NDIS Plan to live a better life in the community.\nIf you are a parent and/or a carer of a person with disability, we encourage you to consider bringing the person with disability along to the workshop. The NDIS is about people with disability so why not bring along the person who will benefit the most? There will be opportunities for breaks and a separate space available for resting and recovering if required.\nImportantly, these workshops are only for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend.\nUnderstanding the NDIS Workshop\nThe workshop is called Understanding the NDIS. It is a 3 hour workshop, with a short break in the middle. There are 3 workshops across three days at different times; however each workshop covers the same topics.\nIncluded in the workshop is a detailed participant handbook you can take home with you, as well as 5 factsheets with even more information about the NDIS.\nDo I need to pay to attend the workshops?\nThese workshops are free for people with disability and their families. People who don\u2019t meet the criteria are not allowed to attend. If you are unsure, please contact AFDO Disability Loop first.\nIf your organisation would like to assist multiple people with disability and/or families to register, please contact AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email disabilityloop@afdo.org.au before registering.\u2028\nWill AFDO Disability Loop provide accessibility supports?\nFor AFDO Disability Loop, accessibility is a priority. All workshops are held in accessible environments with accessible bathrooms in the same venue.\nWhen registering for the workshops, there is an option to tell us your accessibility needs. For example, AFDO can provide live captioning, Auslan interpreting, material in electronic formats, and other accessibility supports when they are required.\nIf you have any specific requests not listed on the registration form, please contact us and we can assist you where possible.\nWill food be provided at the event?\nYes. For those attending a session during the middle of the day, lunch or afternoon tea will be provided. For those attending the evening session, light snacks and/or sweets will be provided.\nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nYou can call AFDO Disability Loop on (03) 9662 3324, or email\u00a0disabilityloop@afdo.org.au\u00a0\n",

                "text": "Are you a community-focused yoga teacher who wants to positively impact the lives of people who cannot access yoga classes in mainstream settings?\r\nYogahood Australia's two-day Yoga Outreach Training\u00a0will equip you with the skills, tools and awareness to work with the wider community in diverse and unpredictable settings, and will expand your toolkit as a yoga teacher.\u00a0\r\nAfter this training, participants will have the opportunity to volunteer with Yogahood Australia and share yoga in local neighbourhoods, youth centres, residential facilities, community halls, and through other non-profits providing essential services to communities in need.\r\nAll yoga teachers wishing to volunteer with Yogahood Australia are required to undertake this essential training. The cost of the training has been heavily subsidised thanks to our community of partners to make the training accessible to more yoga teachers.\u00a0\r\nCurrent Yogahood Australia volunteers are welcome to retake the training free of charge.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nTraining Day 1: Saturday, 9 - 5 pm &\u00a0Day 2: Sunday, 9 - 5 pm\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis training will be facilitated by Via Tendon and Janaki Somaiya, both long-term Yogahood Australia volunteers. More information about our facilititators and special guests are on our website:\u00a0https://www.yogahood.org.au/outreach-training\r\nWhat we will cover at the training:\r\n\r\nPrepare you to teach yoga in diverse and unpredictable settings\r\nDiscuss potential challenges of teaching yoga in outreach settings and strategies for dealing with them\r\nHelp you understand the key differences between teaching yoga in studio and outreach settings\r\nTeach you best practices for sharing yoga with under served groups in outreach settings\r\nConnect you with a community of like-minded yoga teachers who also want to share yoga with those who don't have access to it\r\nProvide opportunities to teach yoga in the wider community\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nFAQs\r\nWhat can/can't I bring to the event?\r\nPlease bring your yoga mat, water bottle, and a pen. Feel free to bring a pillow or bolster if you find sitting on the floor uncomfortable. Whilst the latest yoga gear isn't necessary, please dress comfortably. On the Sunday and during role plays, we encourage you to dress in \"everyday\" wear so come dressed in jeans, pants, skirts, tight/loose clothing. \u00a0A light vegetarian lunch will be provided on both days.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIs my registration transferrable?\r\nYes, you can transfer your training to another yoga teacher up to 1 day before the event. Cancellations requesting a refund must be made no later than 7 days before the event.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nCan I update my registration information?\r\nYes, login to Eventbrite and update away!\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat if I can only attend one or two of the training days?\r\nAs the training builds upon itself, we encourage you to attend the two full days of training to get the most out of it. The option to volunteer will only be given to participants who attend the two full days of training.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nI can't attend this training - when are you running your next training?\r\nPlease stay up to date with us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for all our future trainings and events.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDo I have to be a yoga teacher to attend?\r\nThis training is designed for yoga teachers who want to expand their toolkit so they can teach in diverse settings. While you do not need to be a yoga teacher to attend, you should have a strong interest in the physical, mental and emotional beneifts of yoga, an interest in community service, and a regular practice. This training is for professional development only.\u00a0This training is not designed for anyone in the process of healing their own trauma, or currently experiencing any major physical, mental or emotional ailments. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow will the training be delivered?\r\nThe training will be delivered through:\r\n\r\nPhysical practice\r\nBreathing exercises & meditation\r\nSample scenarios and group problem-solving\r\nShort lecture-style sessions with Q & A\r\nBreak-out small group sessions\r\nRole playing and skills practice\r\nStudent teaching and feedback opportunities\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWill I be provided with ready-made sequences to teach the community?\r\nYogahood Australia does not promote a single methodology or style for bringing yoga to the wider community and does not provide you with ready-made sequences or a list of postures.
