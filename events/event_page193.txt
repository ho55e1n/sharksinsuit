                "text": "Towards an Electronic Prescription?\n\nThe opportunities and challenges for interfacing electrical and biological circuits for the treatment of disease.\nWhen treating diseases of the nervous system, doctors have generally relied on drug discoveries. But uncovering new pharmaceutical treatments can be a risky and lengthy process, and diseases of the central nervous system have proven especially challenging. With the significant personal and societal costs incurred by these disorders, there is an imperative to explore alternative approaches to treatment.\nBioelectronics is the concept of interfacing directly with the body's own nervous system to monitor physiological signals and, as needed, modulate the electrical activity within the nervous system to alleviate symptoms of diseases. The first generation of bioelectronic systems are now treating a number of disorders, with perhaps the most familiar being cardiac pacemakers that aim to maintain a healthy heart rhythm. Pacing systems are deployed in hundreds of thousands of patients today, and reinforce the potential for bioelectronic medicine to restore health.\nExpanding bioelectronics to neurological disorders like epilepsy, chronic pain and dementia is an exciting but challenging opportunity. Despite the clinical success in treating symptoms of diseases like Parkinson's, existing bioelectronic systems have several attributes that currently limit their adoption. For example, currently a skilled neurosurgeon is required to place the implant, and the device's output is relatively inflexible in contrast to the rapidly changing and reactive activity of the nervous system. Resolving these issues requires the complementary pursuit of technological innovation and scientific discovery.\nFor technology, the microelectronics-enabled flexibility of bioelectronic systems creates opportunities for both research and medical device design. Digital technology is adaptable for addressing various diseases, as well as for fine-tuning to patient-specific needs. In the future, sensor- and algorithm-enabled systems might rapidly respond to physiological fluctuations within the body, allowing the possibility of building restorative prosthetics that serve as a surrogate nervous system. In addition, the algorithms used to operate the bioelectronics can \u201cevolve\u201d with our scientific understanding of the nervous system. But to fully realize this potential, we first need a better understanding of how the nervous system functions and responds to therapeutic interventions. \nTo this end, bioelectronic platforms are also being used as a unique window into the brain. This window allows access for gathering data on how the nervous system functions, and then goes awry due to disease. Clinician-researchers can then characterize the response of the nervous system to drugs and stimulation to better understand how more \u201cneurotypical\u201d function might be restored. \nThe flexibility of bioelectronics allows for a breadth of therapies to be explored with these scientific toolkits. High-impact, problematic clinical needs are currently being explored in human volunteers, including postural instability in Parkinson's disease, seizure prediction and prevention in epilepsy, and emotional and sensory processing in chronic pain and depression. The breadth of these studies reflects the diversity of challenges created by neurological disorders, but also the hope that bioelectronic systems can help address them.\n\nYou can hear Professor Denison discuss his oration in this video by clicking here\n\nProfessor\u00a0Timothy Denison\n\nTimothy Denison, PhDRoyal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging TechnologiesDepartment of Engineering ScienceNuffield Department of Clinical NeuroscienceMedical Research Council Brain Network Dynamics UnitOxford University\u00a0\nProfessor Denison holds a join appointment in Engineering Science and Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford, where he explores the fundamentals of physiologic closed-loop systems in collaboration with the\u00a0Medical Research Council Brain Network Dynamics Unit. \nPrior to that, Tim was a Technical Fellow at Medtronic PLC and Vice President of Research & Core Technology for the Restorative Therapies Group, where he helped oversee the design of next generation neural interface and algorithm technologies for the treatment of chronic neurological disease. In 2012, he was awarded membership to the Bakken Society, Medtronic\u2019s highest technical and scientific honor, and in 2014 he was awarded the Wallin leadership award, becoming only the second person in Medtronic history to receive both awards. In 2015, he was elected to the College of Fellows for the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).

At the 2019 Oration, attendees will be invited to make a gold coin donation to a charity supported by the event organiser, the Convergence Science Network.\nFor several years, the Network has raised funds for OzHarvest, Australia\u2019s leading food rescue charity, collecting quality excess food from commercial outlets and delivering it directly to more than 1300 charities supporting people in need across the country.\nOzHarvest now operates nationally, rescuing over 180 tonnes of food each week from over 3,500 food donors including supermarkets, hotels, airports, wholesalers, farmers, corporate events, catering companies, shopping centres, delis, cafes, restaurants, film and TV shoots and boardrooms. Each dollar raised provides two meals for those in need in our community.\nWe ask you consider supporting this cause with a gold coin donation when you attend the Graeme Clark Oration. The sum raised will be announced the following day via the Convergence Science Network Twitter account, @Conversci. Thank you.",

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.

The course fee includes one attempt to sit the exam, but in the unlikely event you need to sit the exam more than once, you can schedule to re-sit the exam at the same examination centre. This ticket will include one voucher to sit one exam (re-exam sitting fee is around AU$350).\n\nFAQs\nWhat are the payment options?\nYou can request to pay by invoice, or pay directly by credit or debit card. On the 'Check-out' page you can select your preferred payment option by selecting the 'Payment Method' drop down menu which has 'Credit/Debit card' selected as default and change this to 'Pay by invoice'. We will then send you an invoice immediatley with payment details. Note, we didn't design this system and have shared feedback with Eventbrite that perhaps they should conduct some usability testing of this.\n\nWhat is the difference between the UX Course ticket and the UX Course & Certification?\nThe UX Course ticket is $300 less than the UX Course & Certification ticket. It does not include the Certification or exam. No exam voucher will be issued with this ticket type.\u00a0Register 30 days prior to the course commencement date or until sold out to get the Early Bird Price (limit of 5 tickets sold per venue for Early Bird).\nCertification can still be organised later directly with the BCS.\nBoth tickets will give you access to the same high quality 3 Day UX Course with plenty of practical and interactive activities & group work. You will also get a printed and digital copy of the comprehensive training manual, 12 months access to over 35 customisable UX templates via our online training portal, 1 hour of post-course personal mentoring, morning tea & lunch on all 3 days. On the last day there is also an opportunity to sit a practice exam should you choose to at no additional cost. Candidates who have completed our 3 Day UX Design course in 2019 can still organise Certification with the Foundation Certificate in User Experience directly with the BCS.\n\nWhere can I find out more about PeakXD and this course?\nSee our Canberra UX Course & Certification\u00a0 page (https://uxcourses.peakxd.com.au/uxc-Canberra)\u00a0for more information including a downloadable PDF syllabus.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat's the refund policy?\nCancellations received 30 days or more before to the course start date will incur a 20% administration fee. Cancellations received less than 30 days are non refundable.\nIn the event that PeakXD postpones or cancels a course (e.g. due to insufficient numbers), attendees can elect to receive a full refund or have their payment transferred to a future course. We reserve the right to change the venue to equivalent standard and location within 5km of the CBD of the booked city.\n\u00a0\nCan I update my registration information?\nYes, email us at any time to update registration information. We will send you an email requesting more information from you closer to the event date.\n\u00a0\nIs my registration fee or ticket transferrable?\nYes, for requests received\u00a030 days or more before to the course start date, attendees can transfer to another course in an alternative city, or date however this is subject to availability, and may incur a 20% administration fee.\u00a0\u00a0Attendees can be substituted at any time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?\nAttendees can be substituted at any time. However BCS examination requires registration of the attendee prior to sitting the exam, and candidate must provide photo identification at time of exam. Additional exam costs may apply to substitute exam candidate.\n\nRead our\u00a0training policy and conditions\u00a0for full details.",

Note, we didn't design this system and have shared feedback with Eventbrite that perhaps they should conduct some usability testing of this.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>What is the difference between the UX Course ticket and the UX Course &amp; Certification?</STRONG></P>\n<P>The UX Course ticket is $300 less than the UX Course &amp; Certification ticket. It does not include the Certification or exam. No exam voucher will be issued with this ticket type.\u00a0Register 30 days prior to the course commencement date or until sold out to get the Early Bird Price (limit of 5 tickets sold per venue for Early Bird).</P>\n<P>Certification can still be organised later directly with the BCS.</P>\n<P>Both tickets will give you access to the same high quality 3 Day UX Course with plenty of practical and interactive activities &amp; group work. You will also get a printed and digital copy of the comprehensive training manual, 12 months access to over 35 customisable UX templates via our online training portal, 1 hour of post-course personal mentoring, morning tea &amp; lunch on all 3 days. On the last day there is also an opportunity to sit a practice exam should you choose to at no additional cost. Candidates who have completed our 3 Day UX Design course in 2019 can still organise Certification with the Foundation Certificate in User Experience directly with the BCS.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>Where can I find out more about PeakXD and this course?</STRONG></P>\n<P>See our Canberra UX Course &amp; Certification\u00a0 page (https://uxcourses.peakxd.com.au/uxc-Canberra)\u00a0for more information including a downloadable PDF syllabus.\u00a0\u00a0</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>What's the refund policy?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Cancellations received 30 days or more before to the course start date will incur a 20% administration fee. Cancellations received less than 30 days are non refundable.</P>\n<P>In the event that PeakXD postpones or cancels a course (e.g. due to insufficient numbers), attendees can elect to receive a full refund or have their payment transferred to a future course. We reserve the right to change the venue to equivalent standard and location within 5km of the CBD of the booked city.</P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>Can I update my registration information?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Yes, email us at any time to update registration information. We will send you an email requesting more information from you closer to the event date.</P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>Is my registration fee or ticket transferrable?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Yes, for requests received\u00a030 days or more before to the course start date, attendees can transfer to another course in an alternative city, or date however this is subject to availability, and may incur a 20% administration fee.\u00a0\u00a0Attendees can be substituted at any time.\u00a0</P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG>Is it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Attendees can be substituted at any time. However BCS examination requires registration of the attendee prior to sitting the exam, and candidate must provide photo identification at time of exam. Additional exam costs may apply to substitute exam candidate.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>Read our\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.peakxd.com.au/terms-and-conditions\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">training policy and conditions</A>\u00a0for full details.</P>"

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d - Psychology Today\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.

This course is not suitable for children and is best for people aged 18+.\n\nYOUR COURSE FACILITATOR IS DENISE CREW\n\nDenise is an experienced mindfulness practitioner and regularly uses meditation and yoga to maintain and improve her mind and body health. She has used the training she received from a Buddhist teacher in Canberra to lead mindfulness classes for children and meditation sessions for small groups of adults. She has been using mindfulness and meditation in her daily life for more than a decade and accepts that it is a lifelong practice from which we can learn how to cope with the stresses and strains of modern life, but at the same time, grow spiritually. She is a qualified and experienced teacher with a background in science who has been tutoring and mentoring young people for many years. She has used this experience to bring a mutually respectful, supportive, and positive environment to her teaching so that each individual can feel comfortable and relaxed enough to focus on their own practice.\nDenise has lived and worked in Australia, England and Germany. She has explored mindfulness through both religious and secular teachings and with many cultures and traditions through her travels to every continent. She strongly believes that mindfulness goes beyond all our differences of faith or custom and helps us to become more connected to our human family, and that of the living planet.\nDenise is happy to work with individuals, small groups or classes, in private, and in workshop or class settings. She is particularly interested in working with children and young adults; to teach them how to use mindfulness as a tool to help cope with the challenges facing young people in this modern world.\nDenise has a successful tutoring and mentoring business based in Bungendore NSW, as well as a growing coaching and mentoring service in the Riverina, NSW. www.heartinmind.net.au\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION:\nIf you have questions or require more information:\u00a0\nEmail:\u00a0karen@mindfulnessworksaustralia.com\nRing\u00a01 800 138 119\nContact Form:\u00a0Mindfulness Works website contact form\n\nTESTIMONIALS FOR THE MINDFULNESS WORKS INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION COURSE:\u201cThank goodness I came across Mindfulness Works.

Every month over 600 people complete the Mindfulness Works introductory course across Australia and New Zealand.\nWHAT IS MINDFULNESS?\nMindfulness means \u201cpaying attention in a particular way; On purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.\u201d \u2014 Jon Kabat Zinn (Professor of Medicine Emeritus Stress Reduction Clinic and the Centre for Mindfulness in Medicine).\nModern research about mindfulness and meditation shows that over time and with regular practice, mindfulness offers significant benefits to people including less stress, less anxiety, greater focus, calm and happiness.\n\n\"NZ Mental Health Foundation mental health promoter Grant Rix says mindfulness has been shown to benefit our brains to such an extent that we can feel calmer, more aware, have an increased ability to focus and concentrate, remember things better and feel happier.\" \u2014 NZ Mental Health Foundation Press Release July 2012\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTHE BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION\nWith regular practice and over time, mindfulness and meditation can offer the following benefits.\n\n\nReduced stress and anxiety\n\n\nImproved sleeping patterns\n\n\nIncreased relaxation\n\n\nGreater self-awareness and emotional intelligence\n\n\nDeeper levels of self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\n\u201cNeuroscientists have found that meditators shift their brain activity to different areas of the cortex\u2026This mental shift decreases the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety. \u2026The researchers found that the meditators showed a pronounced shift in activity to the left frontal lobe. In other words, they were calmer and happier than before.\u201d \u2014 Psychology Today\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH CLINICAL OR SEVERE DEPRESSION\nMany studies show that with regular practice and over time (at least 8 weeks), mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety. However if you have severe or clinical depression, it is important that you receive specialist medical advice.\nFor more information and support on depression and to get help, please visit:\nBeyond the Blue\u00a0https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\u00a0\nPhone: 1300 22 4636\n\n\nFULL 4-WEEK COURSE \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE FOR LESS:\u00a0 Give yourself the full experience of a 4-week course rather than just an introductory workshop or a shorter course.
