                "text": "Spiritual Care in a Diverse World\nPart 1. Introduction to spirituality and contemporary spiritual care in aged care\nAppropriate for those who have direct contact with older people, leaders and managers.\nThe recently published National Guidelines for Spiritual Care in Aged Care\u00a0state that spiritual care is everyone\u2019s business. Spirituality is intrinsic to being human, and spiritual needs may arise at any time. While chaplains, pastoral carers and spiritual care practitioners have a distinct role in the provision of skilled spiritual care, every person in contact with older people needs to have a basic awareness of spirituality and how it affects their role.\nThis session will engage participants in a process of developing and deepening understandings of spirituality and spiritual care. It will support the development of confidence in providing basic spiritual care, and discerning when to refer to a skilled practitioner.\nDuring the session, participants will engage in:\n\n\nUnderstandings of spirituality and spiritual care\n\n\nReflection on real life stories\n\n\nAn exploration of your values and what\u2019s important to you\n\n\nImplications for practice in aged care\n\n\nPractical ideas to implement in your organisation\n\n\nOpportunity to network with others\n\n\n\nPart 2. Acknowledging diversity (ours and others\u2019)\nIn providing spiritual care, we need to develop self-awareness. We can become aware of our values, beliefs, preferences, interests and ways of being. When we know ourselves, we can easily see where we share values and beliefs with others, and where our values and beliefs differ. We come to see that our values are born of our particular cultural, familial, relational, and religious experiences and are not \u2018right or wrong\u2019 but simply different. We can carry an attitude of openness to different human experiences, and celebrate those differences for the richness and complexity that they offer.\nThe session will explore diversity in terms of:\n\nCulture\nReligion/faith\nSexuality/gender\n\n\nThis event is proudly Supported by Prime Super\nThanks to Lyndoch Living for hosting this event\n\nFacilitator: Jenika Graze\nBA, DipAppSci (Nursing), GradDipEd (Health),\u00a0GradDipHealth (Palliative Care), DipMissiology\nJenika is an experienced\u00a0palliative care nurse, who has also had numerous roles in the aged care sector, both in residential care and in the community.

                "text": "Jindabyne Connect is informal business networking and updates. \n\n\nSpeakers:\n\nKath Harris - Profitable People\nand more\u2026\n\n\n Come along to:\u00a0\n\nListen to people who give 2 minute updates or intros to their business\nTell the group about your business in a 2 minute slot (if you are comfortable),\u00a0\nMeet other businesses,\u00a0\nShare ideas,\u00a0\nFind out about business support systems like SRBEC/ASBAS and grants that may be available from local, state and federal government.\n\n\nConnect is a free event however a Gold Coin donations from attendees is appreciated to cover venue expenses kindly donated by Rydges Snowy Mountains.\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat is Jindabyne Connect?\nFirstly it is that business meets business and you never know who you might meet or where the conversation might go. Many of our attendees have had positives meetings as a result of coming to Connect and partnerships have developed as a result. Not only can you meet a new person or business but you often find out something new about the people you already know because you stopped to talk about your business and focus on it for an hour. Regularly people have come to Jindabyne Connect and come away with a business opportunity.\n\n\u00a0\nSecondly the pitches are designed to be a way for a business to highlight themselves through asking for help from the community, bringing an opportunity or challenge to the community, a need for partnership or new challenge from an experience that the business has had. It is not about pure business promotion but a good pitch and a good idea will promote you and your business.\n\n\u00a0\nThirdly we try to include a speaker from Council, NSW Government, or Federal Government or other government bodies such as BEC or RDASI each month. This gives you the opportunity to interact with these representatives, ask questions and get information on what they are doing for the business community. That may be a business evaluation program, a council development, upcoming strategy in town, a grant that is available for applications or a new business program.\n\n\u00a0\nFinally, you get what you put in, so if you turn up with business cards, ready to engage, ask questions and see what you can find out, you might find a partner or new customer \u2013 that\u2019s a good outcome for an hour of your time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Speaking & SponsorshipWe average an attendance of 30-35 each month, and are growing, so come along and talk about your business. \n\n\nConnect events are available for sponsorship by a local business to provide more exposure to the audience, and to help cover the costs of drinks and nibbles. \n\n\u00a0\nIf you would like to speak or sponsor this event please contact Duncan Isaksen-Loxton 0416 325 673 to book in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0About\nJindabyne Connect is an initiative of the Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce, Snowy Monaro Regional Council and Ausindustry with the goal of developing, growing and supporting our business community.\n\u00a0\n",

Many of our attendees have had positives meetings as a result of coming to Connect and partnerships have developed as a result. Not only can you meet a new person or business but you often find out something new about the people you already know because you stopped to talk about your business and focus on it for an hour. Regularly people have come to Jindabyne Connect and come away with a business opportunity.</DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV>Secondly the pitches are designed to be a way for a business to highlight themselves through asking for help from the community, bringing an opportunity or challenge to the community, a need for partnership or new challenge from an experience that the business has had. It is not about pure business promotion but a good pitch and a good idea will promote you and your business.</DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV>Thirdly we try to include a speaker from Council, NSW Government, or Federal Government or other government bodies such as BEC or RDASI each month. This gives you the opportunity to interact with these representatives, ask questions and get information on what they are doing for the business community. That may be a business evaluation program, a council development, upcoming strategy in town, a grant that is available for applications or a new business program.</DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV>Finally, you get what you put in, so if you turn up with business cards, ready to engage, ask questions and see what you can find out, you might find a partner or new customer \u2013 that\u2019s a good outcome for an hour of your time.\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0<BR><STRONG>Speaking &amp; Sponsorship<BR></STRONG>We average an attendance of 30-35 each month, and are growing, so come along and talk about your business. <STRONG></STRONG><BR></DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>Connect events are available for sponsorship by a local business to provide more exposure to the audience, and to help cover the costs of drinks and nibbles. <BR></DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV>If you would like to speak or sponsor this event please contact Duncan Isaksen-Loxton 0416 325 673 to book in.\u00a0</DIV>\n<DIV><BR></DIV>\n<DIV>\u00a0<BR><STRONG>About</STRONG></DIV>\n<P>Jindabyne Connect is an initiative of the Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce, Snowy Monaro Regional Council and Ausindustry with the goal of developing, growing and supporting our business community.</P>\n<P>\u00a0<BR></P>\n<DIV><IMG SRC=\"https://www.destinationjindabyne.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jindabyneconnect-sponsors-400x130.jpg\"></DIV>"
