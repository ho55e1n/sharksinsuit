In many care settings, where time and resources are limited, there can be the potential to provide low end seating and positioning products versus what the patient may truly need. This course will provide an overview to transitioning your practice from general use and standard equipment to the ideas of best practice tissue protection and proper postural positioning.\nFollowing an introduction to seating, we will focus on a basic science of materials approach in the selection of appropriate wheelchair seating products. Discussions will revolve around the advantages and limitations of seating solutions based upon scientific principles, design factors and how the materials choices are applied clinically to address the clients\u2019 needs. This session will provide clinicians with a better understanding of how to match strategies for pressure management and postural stability, client presentation and product performance characteristics.\nWe will then take a deeper look into the common seating needs of the client based on completion of a thorough assessment, and how the innovation and design of customisable seating and positioning products can be used to address these needs.\u00a0This portion of the day will include a hands-on lab session focusing on completion of a mat evaluation. The course will conclude with utilising clinical applications of individual cases where outcomes could be improved with simple understanding of how to navigate the equipment provision landscape in accordance to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability & Health (ICF). This will include hands-on practice of customisable seating and positioning products with client specific cases.\nUpon completion of this course, attendees will feel prepared to initiate referrals, recommend appropriate equipment, and optimise client outcomes for success with customisable seating and positioning products.\n\n\n\nThis clinical education session will be best suited for occupational therapists and physiotherapists.\nUpon completion of this training session, attendees will receive a certificate of attendance.\nMorning tea and a light lunch will be provided.\nPlease note spaces are limited so please register early to secure your spot!",
