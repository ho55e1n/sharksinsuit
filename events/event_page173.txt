This workshop, presented by Katie Welsh of Durga Mindfulness, will focus on the use of props for creating a deeply restorative yoga practice. This event is open to all Yoga teachers, members and non-members alike.\n\nAbout the Presenter - Katie Welsh\nYoga is a central part of my life and is about less about asana and more about exploring your body, your breath, your mind, your emotions, your connection with that which is bigger, and being conscious in how you live off the mat. \u00a0For me, it really is about finding peace and release from the busy-ness of life. \u00a0I have a great love of India and travel there regularly, and my passion for yoga started there many years ago.\u00a0The history of yoga just blows my mind so I love to share some of this when I teach. \u00a0I completed my 300 hour Yoga Teacher Training in early 2018 with the amazing Heather Agnew at Yoga Trinity and then went on to train under Sarah Powers in Yin yoga. I am also trained in both pre and post natal yoga. \u00a0My passion is teaching restorative yoga and yin yoga (and using all the props!) and I focus on accessible peaceful poses and on finding joy in the small things as we practice. \u00a0I run a small yoga business called Durga Mindfulness and I teach at Balanced Yoga and Canberra Yoga Space as well as teaching corporate classes and I am\u00a0slowly\u00a0writing a book on bringing yoga history and philosophy into modern yoga practice. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhat's on the agenda?\nAs we move through a restorative yoga practice, Katie will show you different options with props to help support your practice and tune into bliss.\n\nWhat to Bring\nPlease bring along:\n\n\nA \u00a0notebook and a pen\n\n\nYour yoga mat and bolster if you would like - although there are props at the studio.\n\n\nA plate of food to share\n\n\nDress comfortably for some restorative yoga!\n\n\n\nBookings & Venue\nBookings are essential, please make sure to secure your spot through Eventbrite. This event will take place at\u00a0Canberra Yoga Space, 6/13 Botany St, Phillip ACT 2606.\n\nGet in Touch\nIf you have any questions,\u00a0please contact our Events Team via\u00a0events@yogaaustralia.org.au.\n\nYou can find out more about our presenter, Katie Welsh below:\nFacebook:\u00a0durgamindfulness\nInstagram:\u00a0katie_durgamindfulness",

Continuing their Piano Trio Archaeology, Trio Anima Mundi gives a rare performance of this work, recently recorded for their second CD release.\nConcert Two features two composers who were \u2018Kapellmeisters\u2019 - Haydn most famously to the Esterh\u00e1zy family, and Reissiger of the Dresden Court, succeeding Carl Maria von Weber. The Haydn trio is jovial and bright; and the contrasting romanticism of the Reissiger trio presentation heralds the beginning of a multi-year TAM project to record all 27 of his piano trios.\nSometimes composers believe that larger-scale works can be successfully presented with smaller forces.

His intuitive self-exploration and study into tribal sounds created an expression for his own personal healing journey, inspiring him to share these gifts with as many people as possible. His music repertoire extends from the handpan, to percussion, crystal bowls and even the didgeridoo - being drawn to all instruments that connect the listener to the vibration that exists behind all things.\nCome sit, lay back and join Inner Soul Sounds as he takes you through a series of live worldly sounds. The evening will help you gain deep relaxation and find an all-encompassing sense of peace.\n~\nAlex Klein is a devoted Ayurvedic cook with an intention to educate and inspire people to reclaim their kitchen and their health using Ayurvedic practices and principles. An advocate for cooking with love, Alex is passionate about restoring our connection to the food we eat by sharing ways to gain a greater understanding of how to nourish the body.

Secrets within the \u2018black-boxes\u2019 of HHRA models will be revealed in this engaging\u00a0and interactive workshop by leading attendees step-by-step through the HHRA process. The workshop\u00a0will provide the skills for identifying and selecting the information to perform HHRAs. At the conclusion\u00a0of the workshop, attendees will know how to apply risk assessment methodology to evaluate if\u00a0chemical exposure or contaminated land, presents a significant risk of harm to human health.\r\nTo maximise the learning potential of the group, attendees are encouraged to participate in group\u00a0exercises and share their knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nDay 1: Workshop topics will include:\r\n\u2022 Introduction: What is HHRA? What HHRA guidance exists?\u2022 Issue Identification: the importance of a conceptual site model, 'source-pathway-receptor' linkages\u2022 Exposure Assessment: exposure pathways; receptor identification; default/site-specific exposure assumptions; calculation of a dose; introduction to vapour modelling; exposure point concentrations\u2022 Physico-chemical parameters for HHRA\u2022 Toxicity Assessment: introduction to toxicology and toxicity information sources\u2022 Risk Characterisation: hazard quotients; hazard indices; increased lifetime cancer risks\u2022 Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis: why do this? How do we do this?\r\nDay 2: Workshop topics will include: \u2022 Advanced toxicology concepts: background exposure; assessment of mutagenic compounds and early-life exposure; absence of information and route-to-route extrapolation\u2022 Introduction to blood lead modelling: lead toxicology overview; IEUBK model; adult lead model\u2022 Derivation of Site-Specific Target Levels (SSTL's)\u00a0\u2022 Comprehensive case study: participants will be required to complete a health risk assessment based on a fictitious case study in small groups using the skills and information obtained from Day 1 of the workshop.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWho should attendThe workshop is aimed at people who have no prior experience performing HHRAs but it is assumed that attendees\u00a0will have some knowledge of the contaminated site industry. The workshop should be of interest to regulators,\u00a0industry professionals and consultants who are required to perform, review and interpret HHRAs.Please note that participants planning to attend Day 2 only, will ideally have some prior risk assessment experience\u00a0and/or attended the CRC CARE HHRA workshop delivered in March 2018.\r\nAttendees are required to bring a calculator, and Day 2 attendees are also required to bring computer laptop or phone\u00a0to access internet resources.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSchedule\r\nDay 1\u00a0\r\n8:00 AM - 8:30 AM \u00a0  Arrival\r\n\r\nCoffee / tea on arrival\u00a0\r\nAttendees find their name badge and workshop registration package\u00a0\r\n\r\n8:30 AM - 8:45 AM Welcome and Introduction\r\n\r\nTrainer will give overview of experience\r\nHear from attendees their experience\r\nOutline the objectives for the workshop\r\nHear what the attendees wish to get out of the workshop\r\nHealth and safety matters including emergency procedures and nearest washrooms facilities\r\n\r\n8:45 AM - 9:00 AM\u00a0 Overview\r\n\r\nWhy use HHRA?\r\nWhat is HHRA and what is it not?\r\nAustralian and International Guidelines\r\nThe step-wise process\u00a0 Introduction on the History and development of HHRA\r\n\r\n9:00 AM - 10:00 AM\u00a0 Issues Identification\r\n\r\nIntroduction to issue identification\r\nConceptual site models\r\nSource-pathway-reporter linkage concept\u00a0\r\nTier 1 screening criteria\u00a0\r\n\r\n10:00 AM - 10:30 AM\r\nGroup Activity\r\n\r\nGroup Activity -\u00a0Conceptual site models (CSMs)\r\n\r\n10:30 AM - 10:45 AM\r\n Morning Break\u00a0\u00a0\r\n10:45 AM -11:45 AM\r\n Exposure Assessment\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntroduction to exposure assessment\r\nIdentification of exposure pathways\r\nReceptor identification\u00a0\r\nDefault and site-specific exposure assumptions\r\nDose calculations\u00a0\r\n\r\n11:45 AM - 12:30 PM\u00a0Group Activity\u00a0\r\n\r\nGroup Activity - Calculation of doses\u00a0\r\n\r\n12:30 PM -1:30 PM\r\nLunch Break\u00a0\r\n1:30 PM - 2:00 PMExposure Assessment\r\n\r\nPhysicochemical properties and their use in HHRA\u00a0\r\nIntrodiuction to vapour modelling\u00a0\r\n\r\n2:00 PM - 2:30 PM Toxicity Assessment\r\n\r\nIntroduction to toxicology\u00a0\r\nClassification of carcinogens vs non-carcinogens\r\nRfCs, RfDs, SFs, IURs\r\nToxicity information sources\r\n\r\n2:30 PM - 3:00 PM Group Activity\r\n\r\nGroup Activity : Toxicity Assessment\r\n\r\n3:00 PM - 3:30 PM Risk Characterisation\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntroduction to risk characterisation\u00a0\r\nCalculation of a HI and ILCR\r\nSummation of risks\r\nInterpretation of risk estimates\r\n\r\n3:30 PM - 3:45 PM Group Activity\r\n\r\nGroup Activity : Risk Characterisation\r\n\r\n3:45 PM - 4:00 PM Afternoon tea break\r\n4:00 PM - 4:30 PM Risk Characterisation Contd...\r\n\r\nRisk Communication\r\nUncertainty and Sensitivity Assessment\u00a0\r\n\r\n4:30 PM - 5:00 PM\r\nHHRA Reporting\r\n\r\nReport Structure\u00a0\r\nSupporting Data requirements\r\nAustralian Contaminated Land Auditing requirements\r\n\r\n5:00 PM - 5:15 PM\r\nTake Home Material\r\n\r\nExplain the documents on the USB drive\r\nDescribe the web-links to go to for further information\r\n\r\n5:15 PM - 5:30 PM\r\nGeneral Discussion\r\n\r\nOpen forum where attendees can generate discussion and ask questions\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nDay 2\u00a0\r\n8:00 AM - 8:30 AM\u00a0\r\nArrival\u00a0\r\n\r\nCoffee/tea on arrival\r\nAttendees find their name badge and workshop registration package , take their seat\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n8:30 AM - 8:45\u00a0AM\r\nWelcome Introduction\r\n\r\nTrainer to give overview of experience\r\nHear for attendees their experience (if new participants attend)\r\nOutline the objectives for the advanced workshop\r\nHear what the attendees wish to get out of the Day 2 of\u00a0workshop\r\nHealth and safety matters including emergency procedures and nearest washroom facilities\r\n\r\n8:45 AM - 9:15 AM\u00a0\r\nRe-Cap on Day 1\r\n\r\nInteractive forum providing a re-cap on topics learnt during Day - 1.

She has extensive experience using both deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment exposure techniques to assess potential risks to human receptors for contaminated sites in Australia and internationally, including Malaysia, Singapore, India, Hong Kong, Oman, Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan. These risk assessments involved the use of current vapour intrusion assessment techniques and the derivation of site-specific target levels to guide remediation management decisions.\r\nBelinda is approved by the NSW Environment Protection Authority to provide technical support to Accredited Contaminated Land Auditors for risk assessment projects, and is an accredited registrant of the Australian College of Toxicology and Risk Assessment.\r\nBelinda has provided risk assessment and toxicology training to the Australian Department of Health, Department of Defence, environmental and health regulators, and industry colleagues. Her training techniques are aimed at engaging course attendees via the use of interactive lectures, group activities/discussions, pre- workshop reading materials, use of case studies, and multimedia and interactive materials.\r\n*Please check with your certification scheme re CPD points.\r\nLocation\r\nTBA\u00a0\r\nCost\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day - AUD $ 695 (ex GST)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days - AUD $ 1,095 (ex GST)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscount\r\n10% off for employees of CRC CARE Participant organisations and subscribers to Site Contamoination Practitioners Australia.\r\nTo obtain a discount code for this workshop, please contact one of the following:\r\n\r\nYour company representative to CRC CARE\r\nRatin Mathur (ratin.mathur@crccare.com / 08 8302 3933)\r\n\r\nRefund policy\r\nAttendees can receive refund up to 7 days before the event start date.

For instructions,\u00a0click here.\n\n\n\nAdvanced R\nThis class builds on the introductory R class, providing students with powerful, modern R tools including pipes; the tidyverse\u2014featuring the powerful dplyr and tidyr packages for data manipulation, along with many other packages that make coding for data analysis easier, more intuitive and more readable; and the tibble data type that makes it possible.The course will also provide a deeper view of functional programming in R, which also allows cleaner and more powerful coding.R Markdown and R Notebooks allow the creation of readable and presentable documents as well as a transparent, interactive record of your work.Finally, the shiny package is introduced as a powerful method for creating browser-based dashboards, interactive applications and graphical user interfaces to R code.\n\u00a0\nCourse instructor\nThe course will be led by Presciient director Dr Eugene Dubossarsky or another Presciient instructor.\u00a0\nDr Dubossarsky is the head of the Sydney Users of R Forum. Eugene is also Principal Founder of Analyst First, an international analytics industry organisation. He is a founder of the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA); Director, University of New South Wales School of Mathematics and Statistics Industry Advisory Board; and a recognised industry leader in Business Analytics. Eugene is an experienced, analytics professional of 20 years' experience programming in R and its parent language, S.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTestimonials\nHaving studied stats at Uni I was surprised how far the field has progressed in the last few years, particularly in the area of big data. The great thing about Eugene\u2019s course is I left with a sense that I was up to date with the latest big data modelling concepts but more importantly could also deploy them with some confidence using R. Eugene also made it clear he was available to answer questions after the course, so you are not left hanging. I would absolutely recommend this!\n\n\u2014Damon Rasheed, CEO, Rate Detective\n\nFor someone who does not come from an IT background R is a terrifying program. Before doing the Introduction to R course I had previously done other courses in R but always found myself in over my head because they assumed a high level of program experience (even course that required no prior programming knowledge). This course is not like that at all. It starts at ground zero and teaches you everything you need to know to be able to use R confidently in your everyday workplace. It is a must attend for anyone who wants use R!\n\u00a0\u2014Alix Duncan\n\nData science can be a challenging topic but Eugene\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Machine Learning\u201d course turns complex statistical models into plain English. The course contents and presentation were accessible and I enjoyed the mixture of hands-on rattle() exercises, the challenge of building multiple models with real life data, and the salient theory whiteboard discussions created many \u201caha\" moments.\nIt was a great introductory course and it gave me with a better grasp of Machine Learning in general, a great framework for thinking about it and practical hands-on skills that I can put to immediate use. I wish I had done this course sooner.\n\n\u00a0\u2014Charl Swart,\u00a0Director of Business Operations, Unisys Credit Services \n\nMeals and refreshments\nCatered morning tea and lunch are provided on both days of the course.
