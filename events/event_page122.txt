                "text": "Time Management\u00a0Course for Entrepreneurs and Sales Professionals\nDo you have too much work to do, and not enough time to do it? You're not alone! Paradoxically, technological advances have made managing our time more challenging than ever before. Emails constantly barrage our inboxes. \"Weapons of Mass Distraction\" avert our attention via random web browsing. Interruptions abound in our work environment. As a result, we procrastinate on key tasks and feel overwhelmed. If you feel out of control, you can take it back by attending this time management course!\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #1: The Science of Willpower and Procrastination\nStop blaming yourself for lacking the discipline and willpower to get work done! We now know scientifically the reasons that we procrastinate, and the reasons will surprise you. By attending this time management course, you will have a proper understanding of what goes on in our brains. As a result, you will be better equipped to deal with the root causes of procrastination.\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #2:\u00a0How to increase your willpower and avoid expending it\nWillpower is a limited resource. As a result, we must use it wisely for our most important tasks. At this time management course, you will learn how you can increase your reserve. (These\u00a0time management tips are paradoxical!) Additional benefits included increased focus, elevated mood, and a boost in energy. While increasing your willpower, this time management course will show you \"willpower hacks\" that set productivity to autopilot!\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #3:\u00a0What discipline\u00a0really is, and how you can develop it\nDo you consider yourself to be a disciplined person? If not, you'll be shocked to know that you already possess everything you need to become one! At this time management course, you will learn how to develop long-lasting disciplines. As a result, you will achieve more than you ever have without spending any more effort than you are now!\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #4:\u00a0The Science of Staying Focused\nIn spite of being praised as a talent, the human brain simply does not work well when multitasking. This time management course will demonstrate to you how our minds\u00a0really\u00a0operate, enabling you to optimise your efficiency when working. You will learn how to intentionally get \"into the zone\" or \"state of flow.\" After learning the principles in this seminar, you'll never want to multitask again!\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #5:\u00a0Techniques that ensure you always complete important tasks\nOne major cause of procrastination is hesitation. At this time management course, you will learn how to \"Eat that Frog\" and use the \"5 Second Rule\" to achieve your most important tasks. By completing your most important tasks, you will feel a great sense of achievement.\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #6:\u00a0How to eliminate distractions to maximise productivity\nWith an abundance of distractions, how do you stay focused? You must deal with both internal and external forces. This time management course will help identify\u00a0your\u00a0major distractions and teach you how to dispose of them. The result will be greater focus, clarity, and productivity.\n\nTime Management Course Outcome #7:\u00a0Better email management\nWould you like an empty inbox? Do you struggle to keep your head above water with unread messages?\u00a0At this time management course, you will learn about the root causes for email infestations. By changing a few simple habits, you can regain control and sanity over your inbox!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notes for this\u00a0Time Management Course\nPlease arrive at 9:50am for a 10:00am start\nThe venue can be tricky to find! Please follow these directions:\n- If using Google Maps, navigate to \"Sales Ethos\"\n- Enter and park near Chadstone Road\n- The entrance is outside the shopping centre, near David Jones\n\n\nTime Management Course Testimonials\n\"Ben Lai of (Sales Ethos) gave some great advice and tips on how to present and sell with persuasion and integrity. I would recommend Ben to anyone considering sales training or mentoring.\" -\u00a0Emily Shaw, Director, Executive Marketing Solutions\" - Emily Shaw, Director, Executive Marketing Solutions\n\"I recently attended one of Ben's seminars and found it really valuable and enjoyable.

Become part of the revolution with this innovative and simple Self Directed Healing (SDH) process created by Claire Besley, Principle healer and teacher for Inspirited Solutions.\n\nDates: MAY 24,25,26 2019\nLocation: Inspirited's Port Melbourne Healing & Wellness Centre\u00a0\nIntensive SDH Practitioner training\u00a0\nLearn, experience and master all 10 SDH modules in only 3 days\u00a0\nInteractive classes - master your SDH skills on real people\u00a0\n3 days of transformational self healing\nAll modules fully demonstrated by Founder Claire Besley\u00a0\nReceive on the spot feedback and guidance on all modules\u00a0\nEnjoy an exciting team environment\nJoin our closed Facebook group for ongoing support\nSelf Directed Healing (SDH) Training Program\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe SDH process is so advanced that clients heal deep pain, trauma and stress after only one healing session. There is no form of muscle testing, reiki or hands on healing required. SDH is at the cutting edge of healing. It is the most rapid and sustainable form of healing in the modern world.\nWhat is most exciting about SDH is that it is simple and can be learned quickly by anyone.\nThe course is delivered to you over 3 days an covers everything you need to know to start practising.\nSee the link below for an outline of the 10 Modules that will be covered in the training.\nhttp://inspirited.com.au/sdh-training-program/\nThere are the 10 modules that will be covered.\n1. Session Measuring & Testing Protocols\n\n\n1. Session measuring and testing protocols.\nEach client session requires emotional and psychological before and after measuring and testing in order to accurately determine the clients emotional state and what elements/issues require the most attention. The ability to prioritise these effectively and reflect the rational back to the clients is also critical.\nThis workshop will enable you to:\n\neffectively determine and assess the client\u2019s emotional state of health using the SDH session testing program.\nagree a clear and reasonable objective for the client, to be achieved in the session.\nprioritise which areas need the most attention and how to analyse the issues so that you can understand them and approach them using meaningful and constructive method.\nretest at the end of the session so that the client and yourself have complete clarity on the success of the session as the improvements have been measured and tracked.\n\n2. Emotional Consciousness Training\n\n\nLearn how to use the powerful tools for self reflection created by Inspirited to help clients identify their own state of emotional consciousness. This process enables you to empower your clients so that they can start to learn how to identify their own mental blocks. This work helps to create the motivation within them to be willing to change their perception so that they can a life with much less limitation. This part of the training teaches you how to shift your clients thoughts the way they see there own life experiences and themselves. This work is critical for healing and it ensures that your clients conscious mind gives permission for their subconscious mind to release the limiting belief systems it holds so that you can complete your healing work with ease. In this section you will learn the \u201cmirror concept\u201d and how to teach a client deep and transformative self awareness.\n3. Connecting the dots - how to identify limiting belief systems effectively\n\n\nLearn how to accurately and quickly diagnose the core limiting beliefs that your client is holding both consciously and unconsciously so that you can help them create a powerful and profound shift. Unlocking the limiting beliefs on a conscious level speeds up the overall healing process and ensures the shifts sustain over time because they have been consciously processed by the client, hence they have been SELF DIRECTED.\nThis process creates a powerful alignment between heart and mind for your client.\n\n4. Inner Child SDH component \u2013 healing the past\n\nLearn how to deliver SDH Inner child emotional release techniques that have been designed for fast and deep childhood emotional healing. This process enables and actualizes the process of self love and forgiveness and begins to unlock human potential at the core of the clients awareness. This form of inner child healing is unique to any other because the client is able to heal the past not only through the mental and emotional functions but also through the physical body. The results of this type of healing are deep and lasting. Your clients will feel the shift in perception through their whole being.\n\n5. Emotional release training\n\n\nLearn the SDH release technique that enables the client to quickly release repressed emotion that has been in the subconscious and the physical body for years, enabling both physical and emotional healing. This process is perfect for the clients first session as the emotional release is so powerful that they reach a state of emotional balance that prepares them for the healing journey that will follow. When a client has reached a level of balance it is much easier to assist them in removing the limiting beliefs that they are holding onto because heavy emotion is no longer affecting their perception. A level of mental clarity is reached and the healing process becomes much fast as a result.\n6. Empathy and clairsentients training\n\n\nThis training enables you to sit in clients energy empathically so you can feel what they are feeling and identify where the blocked energy in their body is stored. This process means you will be able to guide the client to move the energy and emotion easily out of the body by having a clear awareness of where it is and what level it is at by feeling it yourself. This is a very powerful healing process that accelerates your ability to release the client from what\u2019s holding them back. Learning how to work with clients energy systems creates powerful healing for the body and the mind. The SDH process combines this powerful healing process with mental and emotional release work to create a profound and lasting healing for clients. The results can be seen clearly after only one healing session.\n7. How to accelerate trauma processing\n\n\nLearn how to release clients with a history of trauma from emotional pain and belief systems created as a result of the trauma. The SDH process enables you to guide them through the process rapidly so that they can be freed from the trauma very quickly. Enabling them to free of the pain they have been carrying since the trauma incurred. This process is effective on all kinds of trauma and has been proven to work for sexual abuse, physical, mental and emotional abuse, trauma that has resulted in mental illness, trauma as a result of loss including death. There is no limit on what the process can assist with in terms of trauma as it accesses the emotional pain that the trauma has caused and releases it out of the body as well and the mind and heart.\n8. Addiction release\n\n\nLearn how to release your clients from addiction by diagnosing the root cause of the addiction and taking them through the craving process in the physical body to release trapped pain memory/craving from the body.\nThis process enables deep healing of the events, feelings and limiting belief systems that caused the addiction in the client. Being able to diagnose, release and\u00a0 repair the originating cause easily and quickly means your client can be free from addiction without medical intervention and long lasting physical suffering.\n9. Timeline emotional release\n\n\nLearn how to incorporate timeline therapy with the SDH process so that the client releases the emotions held in the body and consciousness as a result of the past events as well as the cognitive belief systems created the event.\nThis therapy is gentle on the client and enables them to quickly identify past events that created negative belief systems themselves. This process is empowering for your clients and powerful as they get to learn how to heal themselves using their own intuition.\nHaving a clear conscious understanding of why they think and feel the way they do, readies the body and mind for clearing the deep emotions that are being held in the body as a result of their past experiences.\n10. Quantum shift training\n\n\nUsing SDH tools this process teaches you how to take the client into the states of joy and peace during a session, demonstrating to them what is possible for them emotionally and enabling them to dramatically shift their perceptions of themselves and their lives so that they can become happier and more resolved within themselves.\nThis process enables the client to experience a higher state of consciousness than they have before, opening them to a new and more powerful understanding of what is possible for them.\nThis process is most effective after the client has been through the majority of their trauma and emotional healing. During the quantum shift healing process many clients experience spontaneous healing in the physical body of ailments and illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
