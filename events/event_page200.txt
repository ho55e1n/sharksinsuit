You have a dream of making a big contribution to the world to live with no regrets and leave an outstanding legacy.\nI\u2019ve met with many business owners who are brilliant at giving and neglected themselves which contributes to stress and burn out.

Went from working hard to working easy.\n- Working on own to collaborating and working with clients in $20 million turnover.\n- Resistant to getting married due to sexual abuse and in one month, forgave perpetrator and married soul mate that same year\n- Have learned how to feel and be addicted to pleasure rather than pain.\n- I continually use this formula. I have transitioned from nursing for 20 years in palliative care watching clients die from the results of stress and now supporting clients to live well and prevent disease to live a life on purpose manifesting dreams into reality. I am living my dreams now!! As a result of learning how to receive and filling myself up to give out the overflow I remain energised, joyful and choose the easy road rather than the hard road now!\nThis workshop is for you if:\n\n\nYou want to change and live a life with balance but don\u2019t know where to start\n\n\nYou are feeling tired, burnt out and stressed and don\u2019t know how to turn off the noise in the head\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.

You will discuss effective supervision and its outcomes, alongside barriers and enablers to effective supervision of peers/colleagues. You will also explore ways to evaluate supervision of learners in your own health or human services contexts. The focus of this workshop will be on the restorative (supportive) functions of supervision and will cover the principles of self-care, supervisors supporting supervisees, and supportive workplace cultures.

It has helped our practice turnover big time!\nThat's why #CBismycoach.\u201d Dr\u00a0Sunny Sihra.\u00a0Simply Teeth, Essex\nExecutive Summary\nThe key words associated with this programme will be KNOWLEDGE and ACCOUNTABILITY.\nI\u2019ll be delivering 2-day workshops in Sydney & Melbounre which should be attended\u00a0by owners, managers (business/clinic/front desk/marketing) and TCO\u2019s.

                "text": "Hi there,\nWould you like to know how your thoughts, emotions and behaviours impact your dog? Or are you a dog professional, a vet, or working in the animal industry and would like to know how you can support the dog owner during your service? \nIf yes, then attending the 2-day \u201cBravery Workshop\u201d would bring great value to your life. The goal of the workshop is that by the end of the 2 days you will have inner resources that you can draw upon for the rest of your life. This isn\u2019t a \u201ctraditional\u201d dog-training course. This revolutionary course focuses on \u201cthe end of the lead\u201d (aka the dog owner) and less on the dog.\nSo what will \"THE BRAVERY WORKSHOP\" cover?\nThis 2-day workshop is designed for dog owners, dog trainers, vets, and other people working in the animal industry, who want to learn more about how to troubleshoot common problems with the human at the end of the lead.\nTopics covered in the workshop:\n\n\nYou will learn about the evolution, the keystones and the practical implications of \"THE PACT MODEL\",\u00a0which is the theoretical foundation of the workshop and has been especially designed for the human at the end of the lead\n\n\nYou will learn about unhelpful behaviours and thought processes that frequently interfere and stop the human-dog couple from having a good relationship\n\n\nYou will practice grounding and self-soothing strategies, to set yourself up for success in your training and difficult life circumstances in general\n\n\nYou will learn how to cultivate \u201cemotional flexibility\u201d that helps you create a sense of \"BRAVERY\" and resilience in your every day life. Hopefully you will learn a lot more about self-care and \"emotional wealth\".\u00a0\n\n\nYou will learn to read human stress signals, and the best strategies that can help humans calm down the quickest\u2028without passing their stress onto their dog\n\n\nYou will learn about the concept of \u201cemotional transmissions\u201d that we pass onto our dogs, often without knowing or being aware of them\n\n\nYou will be shown strategies how to increase your confidence and self-esteem whilst interacting with your dog\n\n\nThe workshop will be hands on and it is designed to address common problems that dog owners face in everyday life\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have any prerequisites to attend this course, the only thing you need is an open mind that is curious and would like to grow. ;)\nWho is hosting this workshop?\nMy name is Birdy O\u2019Sheedy, I'm a coach and professional dog nerd. I've a degree in Clinical Psychology and have a true passion for helping dog owners with their dogs.\u00a0You see, I\u2019ve struggled with my dog Luna too. To be honest, we had some very difficult times. We had to go through a lengthy behaviour modification program, and let\u2019s face it, it wasn't always an easy ride.\u00a0I was very lucky as I had access to amazing dog trainers who always had my back, and never gave up on us. After a while I realized that the behaviour modification program was not just addressing the dog\u2026 it was mainly addressing me. And despite realizing this, I still struggled. I love a good challenge, so I put my \u201cprofessional hat\u201d on and researched tools that could help my dog and me better. So over time I discovered certain psychological techniques that helped to speed up training, which proved to be very effective as they are evidence-based and stem from well-researched psychological interventions.\u00a0\u00a0As I want to pass on my knowledge that I've gained from this experience, I founded Paws In Life Coaching. My mission is to help other dog owners enjoy their relationship with their dog more and show professionals how they can set the dog owner up for success, and not just focus on the dog. \nI'm a big fan of evidence-based methods and love attending workshops about anything dog related.\nIf you have questions, please contact me through my webpage \u00a0or through Eventbrite.\u00a0Ticket cost is $388.30 (including GST and Eventbrite service fee).\u00a0\nGeneral information about the workshop:\n\n\nPlease note that you don't need to bring your dog along for this workshop. Humans only. :)\n\n\nThe event will be fully catered for but if you have strict dietary requirements (e.g. celiac, vegan), please bring your own food.\n\n\nPlease bring a dog leash (I know this might not make sense, as there won\u2019t be any dogs\u2026 but we will need it anyway. You\u2019ll just have to wait and see! :)\u00a0\n\n\nPens and learning material will be provided. \n\n\nIf you have been to a BRAVERY workshop in the past, please come along, as this year\u2019s concept is very different to last year\u2019s workshop.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that registration will start at 8:30am on Saturday and the workshop will begin at 9am sharp on both days. We are aiming to finish on both days around 4:30pm.\n\n\n\n\nAlso check us out on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to stay up to date and get the latest news!\n\n\nWe would love to see you and your friends there. So make sure to book today, as there are limited spots available! Also please note, that a minimum of 15 registrations are needed for the workshop to go ahead, as some group exercises don't work with less participants. In the very unlikely event that the workshop will be cancelled, tickets will be refunded. There has been great interest, so I'm very positive of it being a very fun and exciting experience! :)\u00a0\nHave a great day,\nBirdy",

Simon d'Orsogna MA will offer an Introductory IFS workshop (Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th of August 2019 - 9am-430pm each day) ahead of further intermediate workshops and CSL official level certification trainings in 2019.\r\nParticipants in the\u00a0Introductory Workshop\u00a0will learn the basics of the IFS approach from the ground up. Suitable to professionals (therapists, psychologists, counsellors, certified coaches, expressive and therapeutic arts practitioners, and social workers) as well as those seriously interested in their self-development. The Certification Trainings for Level 1 will be a natural next step to those who have completed the Introductory workshop, or are familiar with the Internal Family Systems model of psychotherapy. The focus is going deeper into the IFS skills and techniques, and enhancing personal capacity.\r\nThis two day Introductory workshop is an opportunity for presentations, live or video demonstrations, experiential learning by doing, and provides a safe space to develop a comfortable facility with the powerful attitudes and techniques that make IFS so effective.\u00a0The sessions here provide deeper learning and an opportunity to work in small groups with maximum in-the-seat learning in a supportive atmosphere. A number of experienced assistants will coach and support triads in live learning sessions each day.\r\nSee the online flyer HERE for more general information on both Introductory workshops and Certification trainings, including peer practice events.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTestimonials from attendees of Simon's Introductory IFS workshops \r\n\"Great learning, profound and well-organized. Very competently presented and well structured.\r\n... a great introduction, but as well good for the well prepared.\r\nVery interesting and more emotionally charged than many trainings.\r\nIt clarified my own confusion / incongruence about how to apply various theories to a more holistic approach.\r\nEnlightening! Great to have the support of others to implement theory into practice.\r\n\r\nGentle and beautifully paced. A great balance of didactic and practical work. The latter a bit intimidating but well worth the risk. Joyful and funny at times. I loved it.\r\n\r\nFantastic and full of great people. Actually very energizing instead of draining which can often happen even in interesting workshops\u201d\r\n\u00a0 \r\nWho is this for?\r\nParticipation is for therapists and counsellors, mental health clinicians, certified coaches, or students in accredited graduate training programs. Practitioners working experientially and wholistically will find this approach broadens and makes more acute their existing work through using the steps of the IFS 'parts' model. \r\n\u00a0\r\nNote - these workshops qualify for equivalent hours of specialised training that may be counted towards Continuing Professional Development according to requirements set down by your accrediting body. Registered health professionals have a responsibility to ensure that they continue to maintain, enhance and extend their knowledge and skills throughout their working lives.\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee\r\nGuidelines on continuing professional development (CPD) from the Australian Psychological SocietyandGuidelines on continuing professional development (CPD) set down by the Psychology Registration Board of Australia.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Australian Psychological Society advise that APS Members may accrue Continuing Professional Development (CPD) hours by participating in activities that they determine to be relevant to their specific professional approaches, and professional development goals. CPD activities do not need to be endorsed by the APS. A certificate of attendance will be available. \r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWorkshop size\u00a0\r\nThe size of this intensive workshop is limited.\u00a0 Early registration is encouraged. Previous workshops have sold out in the earlier venues.\r\n\u00a0These weekend intensive workshops will promote beginner and intermediate-level skill building through active participatory learning. Come along prepared to learn by doing.\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0\r\n~~~~~\r\nBIO\r\n\r\nSimon d\u2019Orsogna is a therapist, facilitator, and systems-oriented coach based in Melbourne, with individual and organizational clients across Australia and the globe.
