Join us for the\u00a0warmest\u00a0\u00a0introduction to\u00a0meditation this Winter!\nWhat to expect:\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Light stretching to still the body\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sound Mediation to still the mind\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Play! Fluffy cuddles from a furry friend\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait, but why are we meditating with this much cuteness? \u00a0Won\u2019t I be even MORE distracted?\nThe short answer is yes. The long answer is that Breathe In & Bleat Out is a metaphor for what meditating actually feels like when you first start. Your first meditation sitting isn\u2019t going to be perfect, and it certainly won\u2019t be still. You\u2019ll have thoughts, feelings, memories and dreams niggling at you, gnawing on you and clamouring for attention.\nJust like our furry friends. \n\nThese cuties nibble, nuzzle, dribble and piddle, but I can promise you won\u2019t get worked up over it. In fact, I can guarantee you\u2019ll leave with nothing but a smile! And maybe a few selfies (Good luck trying to get a baby goat to pose!) Instead of criticising yourself for being unable to sit still in perfect, spiritual silence, you\u2019ll learn to compassionately observe this chaos, embrace the moment and stop kicking yourself for not being so damn perfect all the time.\nWhy we chose baby goats:\n1) Fewer allergies than cats & dogs\n2) Cuddling causes warm fuzzy feelings in humans and animals! Whether from our human friends or furry ones, cuddling is proven to release oxytocin, which boosts the immune system, reduces stress and relieves pain! \u201cOxytocin is a natural stress reliever\u2026 it acts on our brain to diminish anxiety and induce relaxation\u201d - Harvard Health Letter.\n3) Researchers in the UK have found evidence that goats are just as clever as dogs, and build complex emotional relationships with humans!\n4) Stanford PAWS program has been using animal therapy for 20 years to raise the spirits of hospitalised patients. Animal therapy has also been found to reduce cortisol in Autistic children by up to 48%, as well as relieve symptoms of PTSD and schizophrenia.\n\n\n\nWhat is provided:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yoga Mat 6mm\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cushion\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hand towel\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organic Cleaner\n\nWhat you need (Optional):\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eye mask\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blanket/cover-up\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yoga Props\nYour friendly warning: Baby goats don't have complete control of their bladders & can get super excited without warning!

ABC Animal Farm began their mobile farm service as a means to rescue, feed and rehome neglected, surrendered and abandoned animals. Some of the furbabies in your class are rescues, and others are bred on the farm.

Also known as shadowgraphs or blue prints, this simple process produces prints that are cyan blue.\nOne of the first pioneers to put the cyanotype process to the test was Anna Atkins who in 1843 self published a book illustrated with cyanotypes. Her book titled \u2018Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions\u2019, is considered the first book to be illustrated with photographic images. \nWithout any photographic knowledge, or the need for a darkroom, it is possible to create beautiful images with the cyanotype process. Images can be printed not only on paper but on textiles as-well such as silk, linen, cotton and calico. Cyanotypes can be used to create fine art prints, books, hand made cards and wall hangings. Cyanotype prints are archival and will last for many decades. \nThis workshop will teach you the skills and techniques to create your very own Cyanotype images using this historic and fascinating process. Every workshop participant will take home a collection of Cyanotype prints created in the workshop. \nStudents bring along a range of objects to the workshop to create prints from; for example flowers, leaves and other cuttings from the garden. Materials such as lace and doilies work really well too. The objects that you bring will not be destroyed or stained by the process. \nThe workshop will take place on a beautiful rural property on the shores of Lake Hume near Albury. This workshop is fully catered with morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea served whilst over looking the lake.\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nAny questions about the workshop please call Raimond on 0400141713\nAre there places to stay overnight near the venue?\nYes there are a number of places to stay.

Our classes focus on learning the traditional strokes, and we use black ink on paper to start practicing and to learn the basics. Our classes are designed for beginner to people who have some previous skills who like to restart practicing on a regular basis. We will introduce water/ink painting and do modern watercolor drawings too.\nThis is an adult class. All materials included.

It allows us to show the world who we perceive ourselves to be. However, the impact that fast fashion is having on our planet is at crisis stage. It is well documented that the fashion manufacturing process is putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on our planet\u2019s resources in a bid to fuel the ever-growing desire to consume fashion products.At Sim\u00e9trie we use natural materials to ensure our carbon footprint is minimal where possible. Our dyes and glues are water-based, meaning they are not harmful to produce or use, nor do they present any dangers to our planet\u2019s soils or waterways.Our leathers are vegetable tanned kangaroo which is a natural, low-emission leather that is harvested from wildlife \u2013 not farm-bred animals. Kangaroo leather is a strong yet lightweight material and is considered to be one of the eco-friendliest leathers available.We don\u2019t claim that our materials are 100 percent perfect yet for a long term solution. We continue to seek raw materials that are as ecological as possible for the health of our planet and our human resources.\n\nRefund Policy\n- Cancellations made with less than 7 days notice before the start of a course, will forfeit 50% of the paid workshop fee. In this instance rescheduling to another course date is encouraged. Every effort will be made to make any exceptions or rescheduling requested with less than 7 days notice although it will be dependent on available time and materials in the given notice period.\u00a0\n- Cancellations made less than 48 hours prior to class commencement will forfeit the full workshop fee paid.\n\u00a0- If for any reason a participant cannot attend any one of the workshops reimbursement cannot be made for that session. Materials and further instruction will be provided for the participant to catch up or complete the course.\n- Transfers of the entire course into another participant is acceptable and encouraged.\n\nAll images by Hands of a Maker",

It allows us to show the world who we perceive ourselves to be. However, the impact that fast fashion is having on our planet is at crisis stage. It is well documented that the fashion manufacturing process is putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on our planet\u2019s resources in a bid to fuel the ever-growing desire to consume fashion products.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>At Sim\u00e9trie we use natural materials to ensure our carbon footprint is minimal where possible. Our dyes and glues are water-based, meaning they are not harmful to produce or use, nor do they present any dangers to our planet\u2019s soils or waterways.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>Our leathers are vegetable tanned kangaroo which is a natural, low-emission leather that is harvested from wildlife \u2013 not farm-bred animals. Kangaroo leather is a strong yet lightweight material and is considered to be one of the eco-friendliest leathers available.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>We don\u2019t claim that our materials are 100 percent perfect yet for a long term solution. We continue to seek raw materials that are as ecological as possible for the health of our planet and our human resources.</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>Refund Policy</STRONG></P>\n<P>- Cancellations made with less than 7 days notice before the start of a course, will forfeit 50% of the paid workshop fee. In this instance rescheduling to another course date is encouraged. Every effort will be made to make any exceptions or rescheduling requested with less than 7 days notice although it will be dependent on available time and materials in the given notice period.\u00a0</P>\n<P>- Cancellations made less than 48 hours prior to class commencement will forfeit the full workshop fee paid.</P>\n<P>\u00a0- If for any reason a participant cannot attend any one of the workshops reimbursement cannot be made for that session.

It IS expression, therefore we can use it to express anything. So, let's get expressing our inner puppies, baboons, galahs and more as these FUN sounds will improve our singing voices. Sounds fun right?Leave your chronic seriousness at home and bring out the inner child. What will I get out of it? For starters, I'll get you vocalising freely and with ease. (its going to be AMAZING)Then, we'll use that freedom to direct our voices. I'll give you some exercises to take home. (I hope your neighbours won't mind)We'll;- Debunk the myths about singing.- you'll feel more grounded in your body.- hopefully sleep better the night of the workshop (Cause we've used our bodies for vocalising properly)- get you excited about singing (in the shower, or maybe in a singing lesson) - bonding with other little humans as you teach them exotic sounds.and- try something new( or revisit something) in a fun and safe environment.There may be a prize for the best crow impersonation, or if you can Magpie, wow. Please share. I'm limited to 8 people, so get in quick.Prices:$30 pre-paid$50 on the day.*******************************Terms & Conditionswww.phoebedeklerk.com.au/workshop-disclaimer/",

There are no \"rules\" as to the subject or style of your composition, only a size limitation - it cannot exceed 250mm in any direction.\u00a0Included with your enrollment are a set of hand modeling tools allowing you to work on your pieces outside of class should you wish.

Both the 96 and 112 trams are only a couple of minutes walk away. If coming by train the 96 tram will connect you from Parliament Station. Some free street parking is available but time limits may apply. Paid off street parking is available a short walk away.\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to bring? \u00a0\r\nAll materials and modelling tools are supplied but you are most welcome to bring your own tools or other aids should you wish.

If not don't worry, we have everything you need. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat do I need to wear?\r\nAprons are available for student use but it's best to assume you will get a little dirty in what is a functioning art foundry environment. Comfy closed toe shoes are a good idea for the same reason!\u00a0The classroom is climate controlled.\r\nAccessibility? \u00a0\r\nOur classroom is on the first floor via a set of stairs. We regret that wheelchair access is not available at this time. For safety reasons, some areas of Meridian Sculpture will be off-limits during the workshops but a short tour of the foundry and the various processes will be offered at t he start of your course.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat's your cancellation policy? \u00a0\r\nPlaces are non refundable and any cancellations later than 48 hours prior to the course commencement will incur the full fee. With notice prior to 48 hours we are happy to modify the booking to allow attendance in an alternate class on another date or transfer to another name.
