Guides are located at the Green Lantern Car Park in a ForestrySA Tour Vehicle or Information Tent.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor those keen to join us on our tour, we recommend you wear warm clothes and sensible shoes and bring a torch. Tours are run in a working forest, and participants are required to be physically fit to navigate walking in the forest environment at night.\nOfficial Ghost Mushroom Lane merchandise including beanies, torches, stickers and glow-in-the-dark T-Shirts are available to purchase on site (cash only).\nAfter the tour, participants are welcome to explore the remainder of\u00a0Ghost Mushroom Lane\u00a0at their own leisure.For more information, check out our website at\u00a0www.forestrysa.com.au/ghostmushrooms.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nForestrySA - Ghost Mushroom Lane\nProud winner of the Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce\u00a0Outstanding Business Awards 2018 \u201cTourism\u201d award\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBelow: Photograph by Ockert La Rou - Photograph of Ghost Mushroom as seen with the naked eye.\n\n\u00a0\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nGhost Mushroom Lane is 2.3km\u00a0long and located within working pine forest near Glencoe, just 16km North West of Mount Gambier. From the Riddoch Highway / Princes Highway Roundabout (near Lady Nelson Visitor Centre, Mount Gambier), drive along the Princes Highway towards Millicent. After 12km, turn right on Kangaroo Flat Road and drive for a further 4.3 km, before turning right into Ghost Mushroom Lane. Signage\u00a0is clearly visible from the road. Ghost Mushroom Lane is not suitable for large buses, car-parking is available out the front.\n\u00a0\nAccess is via a white metal track and suitable for 2WD vehicles. We recommend parking in one of the three main car parks before exploring the trails on foot. Limited car parking is available adjacent to these walking trails. The lane way is one way and a 10km speed limit. There is also signage directing vehicles back to Mt Gambier or Glencoe.\n\u00a0\nHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?\nContact ForestrySA on\u00a0Phone: (08) 8724 2814\u00a0or Tour Coordinator on 0429 682 672.\n\u00a0\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nPlease bring either a printed ticket, or digital copy using the email notification/Eventbrite app.\n\u00a0\nWhat is the terrain like?\nPlease be aware that Ghost Mushroom Lane is located within a working commercial pine forest and entry is undertaken at your own risk. The ground is irregular and uneven, with loose surfaces. As the Ghost Mushroom can only be seen after dark, visibility is also poor. This experience is suited to people with an average level of fitness.\n\u00a0\nWhere can I purchase merchandise?\nWant a lasting memento of your visit to Ghost Mushroom Lane? A range of glow-in-the-dark T-shirts, beanies and torches are available now. View our website to see the range or visit the Tour Guides at the laneway. Cash Only.\n\u00a0\nPhotographs and Social Media\nAs always, we encourage forest visitors to bring their cameras along to record and share their forest experience. While producing clear shots in the dead of night can be tricky, thanks to well-known local photographer and nature enthusiast Ockert le Roux, it has never been simpler. Ockert has kindly put together a technical guide to would-be photographers capture the best possible shots of the ghost mushroom. Visit our website for more information. We would love to see how much you enjoyed Ghost Mushroom Lane. Be sure to share your experience on social media and let others know about this unique opportunity.

                "text": "\"Presence, Play & Polarity\" Organically Uncovering our Natural Magic M/F (broadly hetero-framed) version for singles & couples [We also run other events for those who identify more outside of the mainstream model of intimate relating.] Fri 03 May (7pm-10.30pm) AKA Yoga Studio, East Brunswick  An invitation to an adventure into the rich depths of the self:  Tantra's most practical and effective foundations are in being real, feeling fully, and sharing who we truly are from behind our social masks. Which naturally engages the power and passion of polarity (heart, life-force and connection).  Participants at this event explore fun and fascinating Contemporary Tantra and Authentic Relating practices. Uncovering by experience how to engage more richly with others, and to see and know ourselves more deeply.  With more freedom and openness, the magical and powerful aspects of Tantra start to become more available effortlessly. A lot of more technical approaches to Tantra don't make clear is that it isn't necessary (or even the most fundamental) to master a lot of complex techniques in order to open significantly into our natural empowered potential.  OVERVIEW: * Fun & relaxed partner and small group exercises, * Resonant energy, conscious touch, presence practices, authentic expression, honoring personal boundaries, * A non-pressured social frame with like-minded people.  BENEFITS: * Uncover your natural human artistry in relating, * Open more capacity for connection, joy & pleasure, * Let go of conditioned shame. guilt and shut-down around healthily expressing who we are, * Demystify the practical 'Tantric' polarity of Presence/Radiance,  BACKDROP TO THIS EVENT: Simple but rich practices distilled from Neo-Tantra, Shamanic Tantra, the accessible edges of Transpersonal Self-Development, and the powerful \u2018Meisner\u2019 (acting) Technique. With a nod to David Deida's work, though our take on polarity has always been more related to Michaela Boehm's perspectives.  Easy, safe and fun explorations of the alchemy of authentic relating and self-expression. No performance, no expectations, and no expertise required. No compulsory exercises, and no nudity or direct sexual contact.   ----------------------------------------  PRACTICALITIES:  ** Online Bookings Essential (No 'on the door' admittance) ** - $39 (Earlybird/Concession) [Must be purchased at least 1 week before the event - by 26 Apr! There are also a limited number of these tickets.] - $49 (Standard)  Small Group Events (typically 14-20) ensure the opportunity to avoid the disconnected 'classroom' or 'lost in the crowd' experiences, and co-create a rich intentional space.  Contact E-mail: SpiralEvents00@gmail.com  ----------------------------------------  FACILITATION:  * Arven believes in empowering people to awaken their own teachers/healers through experiential learning. His background includes two decades of immersion in Contemporary Tantra, Transpersonal Psychology and Shamanic Tantra. He has previously been Melbourne co-ordinator and assistant with the International School of Temple Arts. And an assistant facilitator at Meisner Melbourne. He has been running regular Tantra & Authentic Relating events in Melbourne since 2006.  * Supporter/Space Holder: We are delighted to be joined again my the amazing Azra - a Tantra teacher and professional performer, who brings an amazing energy to these events.  This version is the broadly heterosexually structured event. Not because 'hetero' is the only way to be or anything remotely like that, but because of the value of focus. All manner of styles and focus of events are valuable and worthwhile (focused to a particular orientation or very open to everyone). Neither approach is better than another there are just different benefits. Obviously this particular focus will suit hetero- and bi- people best, but is open to anyone who feels comfortable to share practices in this general dynamic.  ---------------------------------------- CONTEMPORARY TANTRA  Contemporary Tantra or 'Neo-Tantra' is the fusion of Tantra, Experiential/Somatic Self-Development, Transpersonal Psychology and all manner of other wonderful sources. It is a very broad field that has been known as 'Tantra' in the 'West' for decades. We use this term to clearly differentiate what we do from the original Classical Indian Tantra (including reverence of deities, esoteric breath practices, yoga etc).  ---------------------------------------- INTENSITY/INTIMACY  If this is your first ever experience of Tantra/Neo-Tantra you might find it a little challenging. Because we grow by dancing on the edges of the unfamiliar, not by staying hidden in our comfort zones. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a very supportive, respectful & organically-paced event with full support to be nothing other than yourself.  ---------------------------------------- SPIRAL EVENTS Spiral Events offer different workshops around reconnecting to our full selves in a culture of emotional repression, and over-reliance on social media in place of meaningful realspace contact. Our original fun Authentic Relating events began in Melbourne in 2006. These were soon joined by various Contemporary Tantra events, and later by our original creation: 'Conscious - & Fun - Speed Dating'.

A lot of more technical approaches to Tantra don't make clear is that it isn't necessary (or even the most fundamental) to master a lot of complex techniques in order to open significantly into our natural empowered potential.<BR> <BR> OVERVIEW:<BR> * Fun &amp; relaxed partner and small group exercises,<BR> * Resonant energy, conscious touch, presence practices, authentic expression, honoring personal boundaries,<BR> * A non-pressured social frame with like-minded people.<BR> <BR> BENEFITS:<BR> * Uncover your natural human artistry in relating,<BR> * Open more capacity for connection, joy &amp; pleasure,<BR> * Let go of conditioned shame. guilt and shut-down around healthily expressing who we are,<BR> * Demystify the practical 'Tantric' polarity of Presence/Radiance,<BR> <BR> BACKDROP TO THIS EVENT:<BR> Simple but rich practices distilled from Neo-Tantra, Shamanic Tantra, the accessible edges of Transpersonal Self-Development, and the powerful \u2018Meisner\u2019 (acting) Technique. With a nod to David Deida's work, though our take on polarity has always been more related to Michaela Boehm's perspectives.<BR> <BR> Easy, safe and fun explorations of the alchemy of authentic relating and self-expression. No performance, no expectations, and no expertise required. No compulsory exercises, and no nudity or direct sexual contact. <BR> <BR> ----------------------------------------<BR> <BR> PRACTICALITIES:<BR> <BR> ** Online Bookings Essential (No 'on the door' admittance) **<BR> - $39 (Earlybird/Concession) [Must be purchased at least 1 week before the event - by 26 Apr!

His background includes two decades of immersion in Contemporary Tantra, Transpersonal Psychology and Shamanic Tantra. He has previously been Melbourne co-ordinator and assistant with the International School of Temple Arts. And an assistant facilitator at Meisner Melbourne. He has been running regular Tantra &amp; Authentic Relating events in Melbourne since 2006.<BR> <BR> * Supporter/Space Holder: We are delighted to be joined again my the amazing Azra - a Tantra teacher and professional performer, who brings an amazing energy to these events.<BR> <BR> This version is the broadly heterosexually structured event. Not because 'hetero' is the only way to be or anything remotely like that, but because of the value of focus. All manner of styles and focus of events are valuable and worthwhile (focused to a particular orientation or very open to everyone). Neither approach is better than another there are just different benefits. Obviously this particular focus will suit hetero- and bi- people best, but is open to anyone who feels comfortable to share practices in this general dynamic.<BR> <BR> ----------------------------------------<BR> CONTEMPORARY TANTRA<BR> <BR> Contemporary Tantra or 'Neo-Tantra' is the fusion of Tantra, Experiential/Somatic Self-Development, Transpersonal Psychology and all manner of other wonderful sources. It is a very broad field that has been known as 'Tantra' in the 'West' for decades. We use this term to clearly differentiate what we do from the original Classical Indian Tantra (including reverence of deities, esoteric breath practices, yoga etc).<BR> <BR> ----------------------------------------<BR> INTENSITY/INTIMACY<BR> <BR> If this is your first ever experience of Tantra/Neo-Tantra you might find it a little challenging. Because we grow by dancing on the edges of the unfamiliar, not by staying hidden in our comfort zones. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a very supportive, respectful &amp; organically-paced event with full support to be nothing other than yourself.<BR> <BR> ----------------------------------------<BR> <BR>SPIRAL EVENTS<BR> Spiral Events offer different workshops around reconnecting to our full selves in a culture of emotional repression, and over-reliance on social media in place of meaningful realspace contact. Our original fun Authentic Relating events began in Melbourne in 2006. These were soon joined by various Contemporary Tantra events, and later by our original creation: 'Conscious - &amp; Fun - Speed Dating'.<BR> <BR> Our mailing list: <A HREF=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FiLCIr&h=ATP1mV47_D7OJ8sMIBdiZmMCEIMQY6LSeUBSr26_Dg84SI5qJXFVtVZVCh2XIdsF5NcEQKG828enR9kKMSZUjyrHmPNDEL5CcGPXJ8TVdkxKu1rdcvA&s=1\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://eepurl.com/iLCIr</A><BR> <A HREF=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SpiralEvents.weebly.com%2F&h=ATMIHoL-ptt1OFA7sDTyOd_E-r_Xb02S6zdKN6UZG9j8qmobT16Nl7p4-4UxFDy91YXnJWcwdU7Wt_CAK_xKg19vK1gBP_JIO0FsSMWj5UNtk-o1o2w&s=1\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.SpiralEvents.weebly.com</A><BR> <A HREF=\"https://www.Facebook.com/SpiralEvents\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.Facebook.com/SpiralEvents</A></P>"

Off the back of this release, Mickey performed triple j\u2019s Friday Arvo Mix and held a sold-out performance of his new music at Sydney\u2019s iconic Lansdowne Hotel.\u00a0\nMickey backed this up with another stellar release in September with his indie-electronic banger \u201cAll That Acid\u201d. The track was spun over 150 times on triple j, supported heavily across DSP\u2019s and led to Mickey performing packed shows at iconic Australian venues, Sydney\u2019s Oxford Art Factory and Melbourne\u2019s Worker\u2019s Club. Not one to rest on his laurels, weeks later, Mickey released his first vocal collaboration with EDM powerhouse k?d on their track \u201cElectronic Memories\u201d which was featured on some of YouTube\u2019s biggest music blogs including Proximity, Mr. SuicideSheep and Trap City.\nThe start of 2019 will see the release of the final single from Mickey\u2019s forthcoming \u201cTogether\u201d EP, featuring vocals from the singer of one of Australia\u2019s most spectacularly infamous live acts, Bluejuice.
