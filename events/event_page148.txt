You can find out about us\u00a0here.\u00a0\nOur Google Analytics training course is designed to tick a lot of boxes:\u00a0\n\nPractical. Our trainers work with Google Analytics and the rest of Google Marketing Platform day in, day out. They know what works.\nOpen.\u00a0Instead of just telling you whats you\u00a0can\u00a0do, we show you\u00a0how\u00a0to do it. We keep no secrets.\nFun. Stuffy learning environments aren't as good for learning as free and fluid workshops and exercises.\n\n\nOur course mixes deep-dive sessions with structured exercises and workshops, with shorter need-to-know modules that download best practice directly into your brain.\nNo other Google Analytics training course is more actionable, more fun, and more BS-free. These courses are imitated by others. These are the courses that Google sends their own staff and direct clients on.\n\n\nHow To Book\nYou can purchase tickets here on Eventbrite. \nIf you prefer, you can pay by invoice. Email us on training@datarunsdeep.com.au and we'll get you sorted.\u00a0\nTraining Venue: Currently TBD, it will either be Karstens on 123 Queen Street, or it will be at our new custom built training pad, on Elizabeth Street, if it's custom built in time.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat People Say\nGreat course that explained things in a really easy to understand way. Would recommend to others. -\u00a0Melbourne, March 2019.\nIt was genuinely the best training course I've ever attended\u00a0- Melbourne, Dec 2017\nSuper informative and practical. They were all great speakers / trainers and the hands on approach was really useful - Sydney, November 2018\nI found the course incredibly illuminating, as I had a very superficial understanding of what Analytics is capable of, before completing this training\u00a0- Melbourne, May 2017\nIt gave attendees the skills to get a good data model going for website measurement. I think the trainers each had the unique ways of delivering the content which was great. It was an enjoyable and fun way to cover the topic of data and analytics\u00a0- Sydney, July 2018\n\n\n\nTraining Course Schedule\nDay One - Google Analytics Fundamentals (Not A Beginners Course!)\nGoogle Analytics Fundamentals courses are a dime a dozen -- because teaching easy stuff is easy.\nThat's why we're going beyond easy stuff and covering areas that we think are the real fundamentals: measurement strategy, analysis techniques, and visualisation.\u00a0\n\n\nMorning Session 1: Web Analytics Concepts\nMorning Session 2: Analytics Measurement Strategy\u00a0\nAfternoon Session 1: Analysis Methods, Techniques and Realisation\nAfternoon Session 2: Reporting & Visualisation\n\n\nDay One is designed for anyone that needs a grounding in the hands-off skills around web analytics. We work through measurement strategies in awesome group exercises.\u00a0\nWe analyse problems, we think about the big picture, and we segment our users.\u00a0We look at models for reporting and visualisation, and we make it fun.\n\n\n\n\nDay Two - Advanced & Applied Googe Analytics\nDay Two plants attendees at the heart of two major web analytics pain points -- data quality, and effective campaign management and reporting.\nWe introduce a tried and tested model to make campaign reporting a breeze, and back it up with a set of hands-on exercises and workshops.\u00a0\n\n\nMorning Session 1: Setting up Google Analytics Properly\nMorning Session 2: Campaign Tracking In Google Analytics\u00a0\nAfternoon Session 1: Finding And Fixing Problems With Data Quality\nAfternoon Session 2: The Google Analytics API and Other Add-Ons Tools To Help Get The Job Done\n\n\nDay Two is designed for people that like to get their hands a bit dirty.\nNo development or technical knowledge is required.\u00a0(There are some tecchy bits, but it's okay to zone out now and again if it all gets too much. We're human too.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDay Three - Google Data Studio & Google Optimize\nA two-parter. In the morning, we get stuck into Data Studio, taking the starting point that now it\u2019s time to tell the story of the data that we're collecting in Google Analytics.\u00a0\nIn the afternoon, we explore Google Optimize and turn your sparkly analytics hunches into legit AB tests that you can start learning from right away.\n\nMorning Session 1: Setting up a report, connecting to your data\nMorning Session 2: Creating charts and filter controls\nMorning Session 3: Principles of data visualisation\nAfternoon Session 1: Setting Up Google Optimize and Running Your First Test\nAfternoon Session 2: Integrating Google Optimize Reporting In Google Analytics\u00a0\nAfternoon Session 3: Setting Up A Framework For Successful Testing\u00a0\n\n\nHang on -- Who should attend this?This is intended for folk that have completed Day One (probably) and Day Two (definitely), or that already know their way confidently around Google Analytics and have exposure to the GA API.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDay Four - Google Tag Manager\u00a0\nThe final day of our training course takes in the heady and heavy aspects of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, working through the theory and practice of an advanced custom implementation.\nEvent Tracking, Form Tracking, Google Tag Manager best practice and funky custom tracking is all included. It's amazing.\n\nMorning Session 1: The what and why's of Google Tag Manager\nMorning Session 2: Setup and basic page tagging\nMorning Session 3: Tracking where the visitors are clicking\nAfternoon Session 1: Getting more specific with triggering tags\nAfternoon Session 2: dataLayer and form tracking\u00a0\nAfternoon Session 3: Implementing more advanced third-party tracking pixels\n\n\nThis Day presupposes some technical knowledge, but you don't need to be a coder to understand everything -- the true value in advanced web analytics is knowing what's possible, not just in how to build it.We give away a lot of our IP here and as such we reserve the right to restrict access to this day's course.\nHang on -- Who should attend this?Anyone looking to take control of the tags on their website. This could be marketing professionals who want to make sure their campaign is being tracked correctly, user experience designers who want to track how visitors are using the site or developers who want to understand how Google Tag Manager works with their code.\n\n\n\n\nKey Need-To-Knows\nWhat's included?\nTraining courses run from 09:00 - 16:30, ish. They're catered, and we're shouting you the best catering that our training venues can put together.\u00a0If you require vegan food, please contact us via training@datarunsdeep.com.au before booking.\n\n\nWho should attend?\nWe've taken everything we know, and split it across three days. We hope that you'll want to join us for the whole ride, but you're most welcome to pick and choose the day or days that resonates most with where you're at.\nTake a look at the full breakdown or\u00a0get in touch\u00a0if you'd like to know more.\n\nWho are the trainers?\nOur trainers work day-in, day-out with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager and have put custom tracking implementations together for clients all over Australia and New Zealand since 2012. They're do'ers as well as trainers, and shoot from the hip (whatever that means) with a straight-up and unflowery style.\nData Runs Deep is a award-winning\u00a0Google Analytics Certified Partner\u00a0and authorised Google Marketing Platform reseller.\u00a0\n\nWhat Are Your Terms & Conditions?\nGreat question. Let's not list them here though. You can find our T's & C's (all of which begin with C)\u00a0on our website.\u00a0",

We reserve the right to change the venue to equivalent standard and location within 5km of the CBD of the booked city.\n\u00a0\nCan I update my registration information?\nYes, email us at any time to update registration information.
