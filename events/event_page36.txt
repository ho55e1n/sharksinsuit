Want to know what opportunities and career paths are out there?\nThe ANU Science Society and Teach for Australia present: Non-Traditional Careers in STEM. \nThis panel will discuss life after University and the opportunities about different careers pathways in STEM that will help you to identify what you want to pursue.\u00a0There are many pathways to make contributions using science such as health security, education, innovation or communications.\u00a0\nOver the course of this event, four panelists will share their experiences, passions as well as tips and advice in these areas and share steps that STEM graduates and STEM professionals interested in transitioning can take now to prepare for their future careers.\u00a0\nThe event will be moderated by Carolina Modesto, Recruitment & Advocacy Manager at Teach For Australia, featuring five brilliant panelists:\nDr Justine Lacey (CSIRO)\nDr Justine Lacey leads CSIRO\u2019s Responsible Innovation Initiative; a research program examining the interface between science, technology innovation and the associated ethical, social and legal consequences of new and disruptive science and technologies. This Initiative is aligned with CSIRO\u2019s Future Science Platforms, which aims to develop the early stage science that underpins disruptive innovation and that has the potential to reinvent and create new industries for Australia.\u00a0\nPrior to taking up this role, Justine led a research group of social and economic scientists developing and supporting adaptive solutions for Australian communities and industries. She is trained as a philosopher and her own research has focused on examining the aspects underpinning the minerals industry\u2019s social licence to operate, and how this concept is used in other resource management contexts, such as forestry and agriculture.\nChip McIntosh (Teach for Australia)\nChip graduated from ANU\u2019s Bachelor of Engineering in 2013 and spent four years working in civil engineering, blast mitigation and construction in both the private and public sectors. In 2016, he began the Teach for Australia Leadership Development Program and found a career that he loves teaching high school maths and technology. He is in his fourth year at his placement school and plans on teaching until retirement.\u00a0\nRoisin Boadle (Teach For Australia)\n\u00a0Roisin toyed with the idea of teaching for many years. She always loved learning and was passionate about her chosen areas of physics and mathematics, but teaching didn't become a reality until more recently. Having completed a Masters of Physics in the UK, and then a PhD in Atomic and Molecular Physics at the ANU, Roisin decided it was finally time to turn her attention to a career in teaching. She was fortunate to be taken on by Teach for Australia as an Associate in 2016, where she was placed in a low socioeconomic school in Tuggeranong as a Maths and Science teacher and concurrently completing her masters of teaching. Staying on at her school after her program finished, Roisin has become the Year 9/10 coordinator, had multiple opportunities to act in more senior leadership roles and last year, was nominated as ACT Secondary Teacher of the Year.\u00a0\nDr Meru Sheel (ANU, School for Population Health)\nMeru is an infectious diseases epidemiologist with interest in health emergencies, vaccine-preventable and emerging infectious diseases. She became an MAE scholar in 2017, and received her PhD from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the Queensland University of Technology during which her research focussed on group A streptococcal vaccines and rheumatic heart disease. She has been awarded a Research Fellowship (2019-2022) to conduct operational research in health emergencies in the context of infectious diseases outbreaks critical for strengthening global health security and building resilient public health systems.\nMadison Hartill-Law (Canberra Innovation Network)\nMadison Hartill-Law has a passion for helping scientists share their stories. After completing a Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours) at the University of Sydney, Madi went on to complete a Masters of Science Communication (Outreach) at ANU. She now uses these science communication skills in a multitude of roles including, communication officer for a local start up Health Horizon, founder of a science shirt business Shirty Science, program manager for STEM Sells an after school program for girls and co-organiser of monthly meet up SCI ART CBR.\n***Light catering provided, with inclusive (read: gluten-free, lactose-free and vegan) options available.***\nFollowing some prepared questions, you will get the opportunity to ask any burning questions!\u00a0In the meantime,\u00a0send any QUESTIONS you might have for the panel to\u00a0Carolina Modesto at carolina.modesto@teachforaustralia.org\u00a0\u00a0\nRegister for this event and don't miss out!\n\n\nFind out more: www.teachforaustralia.org/\nCan't you wait until this event to learn more about Teach For Australia's Leadership\u00a0Development Program?

You're welcome to attend one or all.\nCome along for hearty conversation, good company and cheese and wine.\nJudith Brett will host our May 1st meeting to discuss her latest book,\u00a0From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage: How Australia Got Compulsory Voting\n\n\n\nABOUT FROM SECRET BALLOT TO DEMOCRACY SAUSAGE\u00a0(pick-up a copy in store or buy from our website)\nIt's compulsory to vote in Australia. We are one of a handful of countries in the world that enforce this rule at election time, and the only English-speaking country that makes its citizens vote. Not only that, we embrace it. We celebrate compulsory voting with barbeques and cake stalls at polling stations, and election parties that spill over into Sunday morning.\nBut how did this come to be? When and why did we begin making Australians vote? What effect has it had on our political parties, our voting systems, our participation in elections? And how else is the way we vote different from other English-speaking democracies? From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage is a brilliant essay-length book by the celebrated historian Judith Brett, the prize-winning biographer of Alfred Deakin. This is a landmark account of the character of Australian democracy.\n\n\nPRAISE:\n\u2018Brett\u2019s writing is capable of extraordinary clarity, insight and compassion.\u2019-Monthly\n\u2018Australia led the world in broadening the franchise and introducing the secret ballot, but few nations followed us down the path of compulsory voting. This absorbing book explains a century-old institution, how it came to be, and how it survives.\u2019-Antony Green\n\u2018The Australian way of voting seems \u2013 to us \u2013 entirely ordinary but, as Judith Brett reveals, it\u2019s a singular miracle of innovation of which we can all be fiercely proud. This riveting and deeply researched little book is full of jaw-dropping moments. Like the time that South Australian women accidentally won the right to stand as candidates \u2013 an international first. Or the horrifying debates that preceded the Australian parliament\u2019s shameful decision to disenfranchise Aborigines in 1902. This is the story of a young democracy that is unique. A thrilling and valuable book.\u2019-Annabel Crabb\n\n\u2018This book unravels mysteries, and explains the quirks and triumphs of Australia. It answers questions you didn\u2019t even know you had. I learned something on every page.\u2019-Waleed Aly\n\u2018A tightly written history of Australia\u2019s electoral system\u2026 this is a fantastic read for an election year!\u2019-Readings\n\u2018Politics aficionados might find this very readable and informative book hard to put down. The solution is simple: read it in one sitting, as I did.\u2019-Inside Story\n\n\nABOUT THE HOST:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudith Brett is the author of Robert Menzies\u2019 Forgotten People and emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University. The Enigmatic Mr Deakin won the 2018 National Biography Award, and was shortlisted in the NSW Premier\u2019s Literary Awards, NSW Premier\u2019s History Awards and Queensland Literary Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We celebrate compulsory voting with barbeques and cake stalls at polling stations, and election parties that spill over into Sunday morning.</P>\n<P>But how did this come to be? When and why did we begin making Australians vote? What effect has it had on our political parties, our voting systems, our participation in elections? And how else is the way we vote different from other English-speaking democracies? <A HREF=\"https://neighbourhoodbooks.com/p/politics-from-secret-ballot-to-democracy-sausage-how-australia-got-compulsory-voting--13?barcode=9781925603842\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><EM>From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage</EM></A> is a brilliant essay-length book by the celebrated historian Judith Brett, the prize-winning biographer of Alfred Deakin.

Like the time that South Australian women accidentally won the right to stand as candidates \u2013 an international first. Or the horrifying debates that preceded the Australian parliament\u2019s shameful decision to disenfranchise Aborigines in 1902. This is the story of a young democracy that is unique.
