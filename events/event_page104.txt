The King of Winesteros bids you prepare for GAME OF RHONES, the epic celebration of the great grape varieties of the Rhone Valley, when it returns to Melbourne for one final battle in May 2019.\nAfter a year\u2019s hiatus, the finest winemaking houses from across the kingdoms of Australia, New Zealand and beyond will meet again in thirsty battle. Blood red wine (think grenache, shiraz, mourvedre, viognier, marsanne and more) will flow into your crystal chalice, and local taverns will be on hand roasting and smoking meat and vegetables\u00a0\nThis is the last GAME OF RHONES event to be held in Australia, so send forth your ravens, rally your friends, and prepare for the greatest wine event this kingdom has ever seen\u00a0\nYour ticket costs $60 and includes ALL wine tastings plus a REVEL-designed crystal wine glass to taste from and keep. This event is happening in MELBOURNE only.\n(This event is not endorsed nor affiliated with that HBO TV Series Game of Thrones. But do feel free to be\u00a0inspired by its characters)\u00a0\n#WINEISCOMING #FORTHETHRONE\u00a0\n\n\n\nTICKETING FAQs\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\nYes please. As alcohol is at the event, you must be over 18 to attend. Please bring a valid form of identification with you on the day just to be sure (Passport or driving license).\nAre children permitted at the event?This is always a tough one. The very short answer is yes (providing they are very young), however our events are often very busy, loud and a little hectic so they're really not an ideal place for little people. We suggest getting a babysitter and taking the day off. We\u2019ll bring the wine.\nWill tickets be available on the door?Only if there are any available. But more often than not, \u2018no\u2019 as the events sell out prior. We cap numbers to ensure everyone has a great time and it\u2019s not too crazy as we want you coming back. We strongly suggest buying tickets prior to ensure you don\u2019t miss out.\nIs there a refund policy?Not for this event sorry. However, if you can't make it try selling tickets on the event page as often people are looking to purchase there.\u00a0\nI haven\u2019t received my ticket? What do I do?An automated email is sent upon purchasing tickets. If you don\u2019t receive it, it could be for a couple of reasons. Firstly, check the spam folder as sometimes they get stuck there. Other times, when in a rush to purchase (!), some accidentally enter their email address incorrectly. If that\u2019s the case, drop us an email and we\u2019ll search and resend. But all good, you\u2019ll be in our system.\nDo I need to print the tickets.It\u2019s always easier, yes. But, even better is the eventbrite app which keeps them all on your phone. We\u2019ll scan you in when you arrive.\nTasting, not drinkingWe like to think of these events as a tasting, not a drinking, as we want you to experience as many different wine styles on offer. Creating a safe, welcoming and non-intimidating event environment is what we\u2019re all about so any inappropriate behaviour, of an intoxicated nature or not, that is dangerous to yourself and or others, is just not acceptable.\nWe have a strict\u00a0\u2018no tolerance\u2019\u00a0policy so if we witness any of the above, we reserve the right to take appropriate action and have you removed from the venue.\nI\u2019ve got a couple of other random questions, what should I do?Easy. Drop us an email at info@revel.global\u00a0and we\u2019ll get right back to you.",

This discussion focuses on the experiences of people who toil in the field of urban greening, unpacking the trials and tribulations of creating a green city. We will hear from horticulturalists, arborists and urban foresters as they explore the why, what and how of urban greening. How can we cultivate more vegetated landscapes and what are the blockages? How can we extend respect and build intimacy with trees? Moderated by Aviva Reed, this session brings horticulturalists, arborists, urban foresters and artists together.\nSpeakers include:\n\nPatrick Belford (Inner city nature, horticulturalist)\nSofia Sabbagh (sensual ecologist)\nArborists stories\nUrban Foresters\nDr Ben Cooke (urban greening researcher)\n\n12- 1pm:\u00a0Knowing trees through technology\nHumans are using all sorts of technology to understand the role, worth and value of trees in the world. These include sap meters that tell us when trees are thirsty, Global Information Systems (GIS) that show us heat and energy landscapes from afar, thermal heat cameras that show us the immense capacity for trees to be a cooling force within our concrete jungle and bio acoustic tools that capture a language of sound around our natural environment. How important are parks and street trees in the long-term survival of the urban fabric or within the water catchment? In this session, scientific researchers and artists will discuss some of the most cutting-edge equipment in this field. We will finish with a walk through the neighbor-hood using heat sensor cameras to come to know trees through a new lens. Moderated by artist, Selena de Carvalho alongside urban geographers, landscape architects and urban foresters. \n\u00a0Speakers include:\n\nSap Sensors (Dr. Melissa Neave/ Dr. Scott Rayburg)\nFrequent satellite analysis\u00a0\u00a0(Office of other spaces)\nUrban foresters \n\n\nLunch 1-2pm\nNibbles provided, chats and conversation, make friends, start collaborations, browse plants on display/ for sale.\u00a0\n2-2.45 pm:\u00a0How much agency do trees have in society? Law, Earth Rights & Governance\nIndigenous governance, community response-ability and ecological rights are explored through a series of case studies and reflections about trees and the languages we use. In what ways does our legal system value and protect a tree\u2019s worth? What tools are currently used for the protection, increase and valuing of trees? This session also explores the language we use to remove agency, as well as give agency to trees, prompted by the written works of Dr. Jeanine Leane, Timmah Ball and Ailsa Wild, our exhibition writers-in-residence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3-4 pm:\u00a0Big picture thinking\nInspired by Louise Weaver\u2019s \u2018long table discussion\u2019, we will host a juicy conversation about trees. The long table format is a kind of performance and anyone seated at the table becomes a performer. Talk is the only \u2018meal\u2019 and no one will officially lead the conversation. To participate, simply take an empty seat at the table. If the table is full you can request a seat. If you leave the table, you can choose to come back again. Participants are invited to write comments or draw on the tablecloth. There can be silence. There might be awkwardness. There will be laughter. There will be an end but no conclusion\u2026 \n\u00a0Join us in responding to the information and ideas generated through these sessions and the themes of the wider exhibition.
