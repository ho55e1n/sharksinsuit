It touches on subjects relevant to both the development of empathy and support for wellbeing for all members of school communities.\nMarcus will share some very heartening examples of how this research has been applied in the School of Empathy which has worked with thousands of learners and teachers in Europe and Asia to increase empathy and reduce the negative impacts of chronic stress.\nIn 1998 at the University of Leipzig, Dr Marcus Stueck and Dr Allejandra Villegas, began to test evidence-based, scientifically validated programmes to increase wellbeing and address the effects of stress utilising movement, music and dance (Biodanza). This was extended to include effects on learners, teachers and carers in kindergartens and schools, healthcare clinics, companies and homes for the elderly.\nDr Stueck and Dr Villegas went on to develop an adapted programme of evidence-based Biodanza for teachers and trained teachers in this programme in Germany, Latvia, Austria and Indonesia. Through the School of Empathy which they established together, Dr Stueck also worked on post-traumatic crisis intervention teams after Earth quakes in Nepal (2014), volcanic eruptions in Indonesia (2009) and the tsunami in Sri Lanka (2006) and more recently on workplace safety issues in Iran.\nIn 2007 Dr Stueck completed an award winning professorial dissertation about the non-verbal, dance and music oriented methodology Biodanza in an interdisciplinary research design integrating psychology, physiology and psychoneuroimmunology. He continues his research work into Dance and Wellbeing at an International research academy in Leipzig.\nHe is in Australia for a short time and is only giving two public lectures.
