                "text": "There continues to be much discussion about optimal foetal positioning, and rightfully so because it is often the key to obtaining healthy vaginal births. The subject of \u2018which way the baby\u2019s face is facing\u2019 and how it can impact\u00a0labour,\u00a0has been documented in the medical literature over the centuries by midwives and doctors alike. If the baby's face is up, or at mom's symphysis pubis, it often is cited as a reason for doing a c section.\u00a0\nWith more than enough medical evidence and research to show how babies born in the posterior position or have been in a posterior position during labour has led birth workers worldwide to teach \u201cOptimal Foetal Positioning\u201d (OFP)\u00a0- a handbook by New Zealander\u2019s Jean Sutton and Pauline Scott \u2013 to pregnant women where they are taught to understand how the baby moves during labour, which positions to avoid, and which positions help turn a posterior baby.\u00a0\nTips such as not sitting in the bucket seat of a car for too long\u00a0are given, and mom\u2019s willingness to follow suit is essential. However, the emphasis on having babies positioned in the Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA) position before or at the start of labour can also trigger other insecurities, fears, exhaustion, and\u00a0interventions for mom and baby.\nMany women come to me for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) because their previous birth team missed classic signs of a posterior before and during labour including: going past due dates, mom feeling lots of limbs in front during her pregnancy and back pain during pregnancy, slow-to-start early labour, irregular contraction patterns, slow dilation with slow progress, or even rapid dilation with a slow and often difficult, if not excruciating second stage of pushing, or continuous back ache during labour and where the backaches are more intense than the contractions itself.\u00a0\nWhilst OFP has contributed to the knowledge of both pregnant mothers and birth attendants alike in enabling smoother deliveries, it also has its flaws that have not been taken into consideration such as the fact that research shows that 67% of mothers start labour with the baby in Left-Occiput-Transverse (LOT) and not Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA).\u00a0\nAlso, when we assume that LOA is the most favourable position, we do not take into consideration the different types of pelvis there is amongst women, and even if the mother has the type of pelvis that majority of women have, imbalances within the pelvis can also hinder the progress of labour.\nHaving a baby pass through the pelvis is like putting the key through the keyhole. If the key hole is rusty, there may be problems of a smooth insertion. The key may get stuck and cause difficulties turning to unlock or even removing the key. The good news is there are many things that pregnant women can do to not just help with the key \u2013 key, meaning the baby! And there is a lot more than she can do to create space within the keyhole \u2013 meaning the pelvis, for the baby to pass through.\nThis is where \u2018Optimal Maternal Positioning\u2019 (OMP) comes in. OMP is an equally important concept which has a direct impact on optimal foetal positioning. Creating a smooth path for the baby to navigate through the pelvis during labour and birth depends on the ability for the baby to work through the cardinal movements during the processes of descent and dilation. And because of this perspective, the teamwork between the mother and her baby will give her the best chance of a swifter easier delivery.\u00a0\n\u201cBringing alignment and mobility\u00a0within the mother\u2019s pelvis enables the baby\u2019s cardinal movements\u00a0to facilitate labor progress\u201d\n\nWorkshop Outline:\n\n\nWhat is Optimal Fetal Positioning (OFP)?\n\n\nShortfalls of OFP\n\n\nWhat is Optimal Maternal Positioning (OMP)?\n\n\nPelvic Alignment\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importance of pelvic alignment to enhance pelvic mobility\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols\n\n\nPelvic Mobility\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levels of the Pelvis & Cardinal Movements\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intrinsic vs Extrinsic mobility of the pelvis\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Modify the pelvic openings\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Comfort measures\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Facilitate cardinal movements\n\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocol for Pregnancy\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocols for Pregnancy\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daily Maternal Movements\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018One a Day\u2019 Pregnancy Stretches\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prenatal Bonding & Awareness\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy Discomforts & Pain\n\n\nNavigating Road Blocks\n\n\nAssessing Labor Progress\n\n\nLabor & Birth:\u00a0Learn to use these protocols to facilitate baby\u2019s cardinal movements through the various levels of the pelvis to enable labor to progress\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol\n\n\nIBPA Online Mentoring & OMP Accreditation\n\n\n\n1.

                "html": "<P>There continues to be much discussion about optimal foetal positioning, and rightfully so because it is often the key to obtaining healthy vaginal births. The subject of \u2018which way the baby\u2019s face is facing\u2019 and how it can impact\u00a0labour,\u00a0has been documented in the medical literature over the centuries by midwives and doctors alike. If the baby's face is up, or at mom's symphysis pubis, it often is cited as a reason for doing a c section.\u00a0</P>\n<P>With more than enough medical evidence and research to show how babies born in the posterior position or have been in a posterior position during labour has led birth workers worldwide to teach \u201cOptimal Foetal Positioning\u201d (OFP)\u00a0- a handbook by New Zealander\u2019s Jean Sutton and Pauline Scott \u2013 to pregnant women where they are taught to understand how the baby moves during labour, which positions to avoid, and which positions help turn a posterior baby.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Tips such as not sitting in the bucket seat of a car for too long\u00a0are given, and mom\u2019s willingness to follow suit is essential. However, the emphasis on having babies positioned in the Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA) position before or at the start of labour can also trigger other insecurities, fears, exhaustion, and\u00a0interventions for mom and baby.</P>\n<P>Many women come to me for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) because their previous birth team missed classic signs of a posterior before and during labour including: going past due dates, mom feeling lots of limbs in front during her pregnancy and back pain during pregnancy, slow-to-start early labour, irregular contraction patterns, slow dilation with slow progress, or even rapid dilation with a slow and often difficult, if not excruciating second stage of pushing, or continuous back ache during labour and where the backaches are more intense than the contractions itself.\u00a0</P>\n<P>Whilst OFP has contributed to the knowledge of both pregnant mothers and birth attendants alike in enabling smoother deliveries, it also has its flaws that have not been taken into consideration such as the fact that research shows that 67% of mothers start labour with the baby in Left-Occiput-Transverse (LOT) and not Left-Occiput-Anterior (LOA).\u00a0</P>\n<P>Also, when we assume that LOA is the most favourable position, we do not take into consideration the different types of pelvis there is amongst women, and even if the mother has the type of pelvis that majority of women have, imbalances within the pelvis can also hinder the progress of labour.</P>\n<P>Having a baby pass through the pelvis is like putting the key through the keyhole. If the key hole is rusty, there may be problems of a smooth insertion. The key may get stuck and cause difficulties turning to unlock or even removing the key. The good news is there are many things that pregnant women can do to not just help with the key \u2013 key, meaning the baby! And there is a lot more than she can do to create space within the keyhole \u2013 meaning the pelvis, for the baby to pass through.</P>\n<P>This is where \u2018Optimal Maternal Positioning\u2019 (OMP) comes in. OMP is an equally important concept which has a direct impact on optimal foetal positioning. Creating a smooth path for the baby to navigate through the pelvis during labour and birth depends on the ability for the baby to work through the cardinal movements during the processes of descent and dilation. And because of this perspective, the teamwork between the mother and her baby will give her the best chance of a swifter easier delivery.\u00a0</P>\n<P><STRONG><EM>\u201cBringing alignment and mobility\u00a0within the mother\u2019s pelvis enables the baby\u2019s cardinal movements\u00a0</EM></STRONG><STRONG><EM>to facilitate labor progress\u201d</EM></STRONG></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>Workshop Outline</STRONG>:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>What is Optimal Fetal Positioning (OFP)?</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Shortfalls of OFP</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>What is Optimal Maternal Positioning (OMP)?</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Pelvic Alignment</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importance of pelvic alignment to enhance pelvic mobility</P>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Pelvic Mobility\u00a0</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levels of the Pelvis &amp; Cardinal Movements<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intrinsic vs Extrinsic mobility of the pelvis<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Modify the pelvic openings<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Comfort measures<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol: Facilitate cardinal movements<BR></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Pregnancy</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocol for Pregnancy<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocols for Pregnancy<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daily Maternal Movements<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018One a Day\u2019 Pregnancy Stretches<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prenatal Bonding &amp; Awareness<BR>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy Discomforts &amp; Pain<BR></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>Navigating Road Blocks</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Assessing Labor Progress</P>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<P>Labor &amp; Birth:\u00a0Learn to use these protocols to facilitate baby\u2019s cardinal movements through the various levels of the pelvis to enable labor to progress\u00a0</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Alignment Protocols</P>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic Mobility Protocol</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<P>IBPA Online Mentoring &amp; OMP Accreditation</P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P>1.

You\u2019ll look at developing and structuring original stories with a feminist focus, talk about angles and interview techniques, research and revision, as well as where and how to pitch. Writing is a craft and in this intimate setting, participants will emerge with the necessary tools to tell their own true stories.\u00a0\nParticipants will be required to bring a pitch idea or outline for a potential piece of writing to share in the workshop.\u00a0This workshop is open to women and non-binary writers.\u202f\nAbout the facilitator\nAnna Krien is the author of the award-winning\u00a0Night Games\u00a0and\u00a0Into the Woods, as well as two Quarterly Essays,\u00a0Us and Them\u00a0and\u00a0The Long Goodbye.

Manifestation Clearing - clear your field to resonate with what you want to have and create in your life and make it easier to take the actions most congruent with creating it!\n3.

In this instalment of the Revitalise Centre\u2019s FREE Sunday Series of workshops, we\u2019ll discuss the traditional model of weight-loss dieting and why it doesn\u2019t work; the deep-seated emotional connection we have with food, and how to make this work for you rather than against you; and share why there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach when it comes to weight management. Janine will share her journey with disordered eating, and how this led her to discover a deeper connection with herself and her body. Jacqui will explain how to understand the way your unique body type, metabolic type and gene expression affect your diet, lifestyle and exercise choices, and how to discover the best ways to eat, live and move for you. Leesa will discuss some of the key hormonal, metabolic and nutritional factors that can affect healthy weight management, and simple ways to uncover and correct any health issues that may contribute to weight gain and difficulty shifting weight. We\u2019ll also touch upon the hormonal transitions that occur at puberty and peri-menopause, why these can alter body weight, and how best to manage these transitions smoothly. Our hope with this discussion is that you\u2019ll get a chance to ask any questions you may have about healthy weight management, and come away with some tips and tools to help you on your journey to health and wellness. Our ultimate goal is to help you pursue a life filled with health, vitality and energy, so you can be free to live your best life. We\u2019ll all be available for quick one-on-one chats afterwards if you\u2019d like to discuss anything with us, and there will be some special on-the-day offers to take advantage of if you\u2019re ready to take action! We really look forward to seeing you there.",
