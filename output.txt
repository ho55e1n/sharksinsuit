However, it begins with recognising there are no difficult people \u2013 there are only \"people\", and sometimes people exhibit difficult behaviours. While you cannot change other people, this course will empower you to deal with difficult behaviours by recognising and understanding the intents behind them and responding assertively.\n\nThis course is ideal for\nAnyone who encounters strong personalities or challenging behaviours in the workplace when dealing with difficult co-workers, customers, suppliers, managers or staff.\n\nWhat you will learn\n\n\nRecognise difficult behaviours and the intents that drive them.\n\n\nSelect the best strategies to deal with different types of behaviours.\n\n\nTake action by using assertive communication techniques to deal with difficult behaviours.\n\n\nUse behavioural-based language to make your point clearly.\n\n\nUnderstand and manage the emotional processes that both you and the person exhibiting the difficult behaviour may experience.\n\n\n\nTopics covered in this training course\n\n\n\nIdentifying difficult behavioursUse the lens of understanding to identify the difficult behaviour you are dealing with and what to do about it.\nThe ladder of inferenceUse this tool to help you decide if you are dealing with genuinely difficult behaviour or misperception.\nDifficult behaviours are not assertivePeople displaying difficult behaviours are not usually being assertive; they show aggressive, passive, or passive-aggressive tendencies that you must deal with using a different approach and skill set.\nDealing with high emotionsThe hardest part of dealing with difficult behaviours is the high emotions that often come along with them. Learn techniques to use your voice to manage others' emotions while remaining calm and assertive.\nAnger and our brainsUnderstand the different functions of our brains and how they process emotions, thoughts and information.\nResponding with assertivenessAssertive communication is a set of learned skills. When people communicate or behave assertively, they are working towards an outcome or solution that satisfies both or all parties.\nUsing behavioural based language to minimise difficult behavioursToo often, when we need to talk to someone about their difficult behaviours, we skirt around the real issues. Using language that describes specific behaviours makes it easier for you to get to the point and others to understand what you want them to change.\nAssertive communication techniquesWhen people display difficult behaviours and you don\u2019t deal with them assertively, it will continue and may even get progressively worse. Learn some practical techniques and sentence starters to help you take action.\n\n",
