      "text": "Collaborate. Negotiate. Resolve conflict. Optimise stakholder alignment.\nIf you are conducting negotiations with Indian counterparts, a strong understanding of how process, commercial issues and culture impacts negotiation styles is critical. • What processes may be adopted to achieve mutual gains with an Indian counterpart in a negotiation? • How do you plan for and respond to lengthy multi-stage negotiations with Indian counterparts? • How does culture affect commercial outcomes in a negotiation with Indian counterparts? \nThe ApproachThis practical, participatory one-day program combines global perspectives on cross-cultural negotiation with Australian executive insights and reflections from Indian counterparts. It incorporates the Consensus Building Institute’s world-leading Mutual Gains Approach, built in partnership with faculty from Harvard and MIT, which utilises a practical four-step methodology for improving negotiation results in Indian contexts:\n1. Prepare – Estimate your Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) and identify the interests of your Indian counterparts\n2. Create Value – Invent without committing. Float options that consider the differences between parties. \n3. Distribute Value – Behave in ways that build trust. Find objective values both parties can use to justify mutually beneficial sharing of the value created. \n4. Follow Through – Specify mechanisms to deal with predictable surprises. Agree on monitoring arrangements, including metrics. \nWhat you will learn\nThis program will help you learn to enhance your commercial relationships and achieve optimal business outcomes in an Indian context.\nFacilitators\nAndrew Wei-Min Lee is a Fellow of Harvard Law School’s Program on Negotiation and Stanford Law School’s Gould Center for Conflict Resolution. For over 14 years, he has led training workshops on negotiation and business in China as well as business negotiations with Chinese counterparts in the United States, Singapore, the Netherlands, Russia, Austria, Japan and France. He has cooperated with universities to deliver programs to Australian executives visiting China.

      "text": "Keywords for India Lecture Series\nEmpire\nwith Professor Sanjay Subrahmayam \nAbout the talk:\nTo some 'empire' in the context of India/South Asia is necessarily a reference to the British Raj, especially after 1858. But the term actually has a much more general usage. It is used to refer to the large political formations of the classical period, such as those of the Mauryas, Kushanas or Guptas; then to some later formations such as Vijayanagara and the Mughals. At the same time, there is a tendency to speak of certain periods as being \"between empires\". In this lecture, I will address three related questions. (1) the use of the term 'empire' in global history, and various successful and less successful attempts to define it; (2) its use in Indian contexts, and what (if anything) it translates; and (3) whether elements of empire can still be found in the Indian political system as it exists today.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nProfessor Sanjay Subrahmayam, Distinguished Professor & Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, UCLA. \nSanjay Subrahmanyam, Distinguished Professor and Irving and Jean Stone Endowed Chair in Social Sciences, joined UCLA in 2004 from Oxford. Educated at the Delhi School of Economics, the first decade of his working career was spent (with brief interruptions in Philadelphia and Cambridge) teaching economic history and comparative economic development at the same institution, where he was eventually named Professor of Economic History (1993-95). Thereafter, Subrahmanyam taught from 1995 to 2002 as Directeur d’études in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), where his position was on the economic and social history of early modern India and the Indian Ocean world. In 2002, Subrahmanyam was appointed as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Indian History and Culture at the University of Oxford, a position he held for two years.\nAfter joining UCLA, Subrahmanyam served from 2005 to 2011 as founding Director of UCLA's Center for India and South Asia. He teaches courses on medieval and early modern South Asian and Indian Ocean history, the history of European expansion, the comparative history of early modern empires, and various aspects of world history. He continues to advise graduate students on Indian history, the history of the Iberian empires, and more generally on forms of \"connected histories\". Subrahmanyam was Joint Managing Editor of the Indian Economic and Social History Review for over a decade, besides serving on the boards of a number of other journals in the US, UK, France, Portugal, and elsewhere. He was also one of the founding editors of the \"South Asia Across the Disciplines (SAAD)\" monograph series.In 2013, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was elected to a Chair in Early Modern Global History at the Collège de France in Paris, and delivered a full series of lectures there over the year 2013-14. Since 2014 he continues to lecture as a long-term visiting professor, and has a regular media presence in France: TV interviews appear for example on MediaPart (May 2014), and on France Info (April 2015). Sanjay Subrahmanyam's book Europe's India: Words, People, Empires, 1500-1800, appeared in 2017 from Harvard University Press, and in a French translation in 2018. Another book, Empires Between Islam and Christianity, 1500-1800, has appeared in 2018 in the Indian edition (Permanent Black) and the US edition in 2019.\nIn February 2019, Sanjay Subrahmanyam was awarded the Dan David Prize for History (jointly with Kenneth Pomeranz, Chicago). "

      "text": "This seminar will examine the ways in which precarious geopolitics along India and China’s contested borders are transforming life in the Himalaya. The possibility of violent conflict arising out of China-India-Pakistan tensions, however, is only one of the region’s problems. The Himalaya is home to a mosaic of ethnic groups and threatened languages. Its ice-deposits (the world’s third largest) feed most of Asia’s large rivers. Militarisation and unchecked development threaten vulnerable communities and fragile ecologies. To make matters worse, the Himalaya is experiencing a warming climate at twice global averages, already leading to landslides and flooding. I will argue that this situation requires an urgent rethinking of the region, one that goes well beyond a states-and-security centred approach to international politics.\nAbout the Speaker\nDr Alexander E Davis is a ‘new generation network’ postdoctoral research fellow in the La Trobe University’s Department of Politics, Media and Philosophy and the Australia India Institute. He is the author of India and the Anglosphere: Race, Identity and Hierarchy in International Relations (2018)."

      "text": "Prof. Thomas Blom Hansen, Department of Anthropology, Stanford University\nUntil the 1970s, India’s industrial and commercial economy was dominated by very small trading communities that converted their expertise and capital into modern industrial entrepreneurship. Beginning in the late 1980s, liberalization made the Indian economy vastly more dynamic but did it also transform the social basis of the private sector, or the labor market? Did a more open market also open opportunities for new groups and categories of people? Is there evidence that the high growth rates in India also break down barriers to social mobility as it has happened in other societies? Or are the deeper patterns of the Indian economy consolidating the existing distribution of opportunities, capital and employment?\n \nContact details: Sahar Ghumkhor ghumkhor@unimelb.edu.au \n\n"
